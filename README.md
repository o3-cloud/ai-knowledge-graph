# AI Knowledge Graph

A structured knowledge base for AI-native systems, autonomous agent architecture, and modern software engineering practices.

## Overview

This repository captures research, insights, and learning on:
- **AI-Native Systems**: Continuous, event-driven autonomous agent architectures replacing batch-oriented AI-enabled workflows
- **Agent Architecture**: Context management, orchestration patterns, and multi-repo reasoning for AI systems
- **Platform Engineering**: Infrastructure for AI agents, real-time streams, and agentic workflows
- **Software Patterns**: Knowledge graphs, architectural decision records, and context engineering
- **Developer Productivity**: AI-assisted workflows, prompt learning, and practical agent implementation

## Structure

```
docs/log/          # Timestamped research and learning logs
.claude/           # Claude Code configuration and skills
```

### Log Entry Format

Each log captures:
- **Summary**: High-level takeaway
- **Event Type**: Video, article, research, code review, deep dive, or meeting
- **Sources**: Referenced materials with links
- **Tags**: Searchable topics across the knowledge base
- **Content**: Detailed notes with key concepts and implications

## Key Topics

- **Autonomous Agents**: Super-exponential autonomy growth, event-driven systems
- **Context Engineering**: Code graph context, RAG, knowledge graph patterns
- **Multi-Repository Systems**: RepoSwarm, architecture hubs, cross-repo reasoning
- **AI Infrastructure**: Agent coordination, stream processing, escalation patterns

## Usage

Browse logs in `docs/log/` organized by date. Each entry includes tags for discovering related topics and sources for diving deeper.
