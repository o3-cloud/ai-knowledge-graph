# How Custom GPTs Can Make You a Better Manager

**Speaker:** Hilary Gridley (Head of Core Product, Whoop)
**Interviewer:** Claire Vo
**Publication:** How I AI
**Date:** May 19, 2025
**Duration:** ~36 minutes

## Overview

Hilary Gridley shares her approach to creating custom GPTs that think and give feedback like her, allowing her to scale herself and create time for higher-value work. The key insight: reverse-engineer your own decision criteria into evaluation rubrics AI can consistently apply.

## The Core Concept

### GPTs That "Think Like You"

**The problem:** Managers become bottlenecks for feedback and decisions.

**The solution:** Create GPTs that encode your thinking patterns, allowing team members to get "you-quality" feedback without waiting for you.

### Why Custom GPTs

- No prompt engineering required
- Persistent instructions
- Shareable with team
- Consistent application of criteria

## The Process

### Step 1: Reverse Engineer Your Decision Criteria

**Ask yourself:**
- How do I actually evaluate this?
- What makes something good vs. bad?
- What patterns do I look for?
- What are my pet peeves?

**Method:** Start with your own recommendations/feedback and work backwards to find the underlying criteria.

### Step 2: Turn Expertise into Rubrics

Convert tacit knowledge into explicit evaluation criteria:

| Tacit | Explicit |
|-------|----------|
| "This feels off" | "The headline doesn't match the body content" |
| "Needs more polish" | "Missing transitions between sections" |
| "Good enough" | "Meets all 5 criteria at level 3+" |

### Step 3: Create the GPT

Build a custom GPT with:
- Your evaluation rubric
- Example good/bad outputs
- Specific instructions for feedback format
- Context about your standards

### Step 4: Test and Iterate

- Run your own work through it
- Compare GPT feedback to your feedback
- Refine criteria based on gaps
- Improve examples

## Practical Applications

### 1. Slide Deck Evaluator

**Purpose:** Review presentations before team shows them to you

**Criteria might include:**
- Clear narrative arc
- Data supports claims
- Visual clarity
- Executive summary quality
- Call to action clarity

### 2. Writing Improver

**Purpose:** Elevate team writing quality

**Criteria might include:**
- Clarity and concision
- Strong opening
- Logical flow
- Appropriate tone
- Actionable conclusions

### 3. Recommendation Algorithm

**Purpose:** Evaluate product recommendations

**Criteria might include:**
- User value proposition
- Business case strength
- Technical feasibility
- Risk assessment
- Success metrics defined

## The Value of Articulating Taste

### Why This Matters

Forcing yourself to articulate decision criteria:
- Clarifies your own thinking
- Makes you more consistent
- Enables delegation
- Improves team understanding

### Hidden Benefit

**Better meeting access:** When your written point of view is stronger, you get invited to more strategic meetings.

## Scaling Across Teams

### How to Deploy

1. Create GPT for your most common feedback areas
2. Share with direct reports
3. Establish "GPT-first" culture for drafts
4. Reserve your time for exceptions and judgment calls

### The Multiplier Effect

Instead of reviewing 10 documents:
- Team runs drafts through GPT first
- You review 3 that need human judgment
- Quality floor rises across all work
- Your time goes to higher-value activities

## The Gender Gap Note

Research from Norwegian School of Economics shows significant gender disparities in AI tool adoption. Gridley's course and approach aim to make AI accessible to all managers regardless of technical background.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Reverse engineer yourself** — Start with your feedback, extract the criteria
2. **Explicit > tacit** — Turn intuition into evaluation rubrics
3. **No prompt engineering needed** — Custom GPTs handle this
4. **Test with your own work** — Validate GPT matches your judgment
5. **GPT-first culture** — Team drafts go through GPT before you
6. **Scale your taste** — Consistent standards without your time
7. **Better writing = better access** — Quality opens strategic doors
8. **Articulating taste clarifies thinking** — Benefit to you, not just team

## The Bottom Line

Custom GPTs offer managers a way to scale their judgment without sacrificing quality. The key is reverse-engineering your own decision criteria—turning tacit knowledge into explicit rubrics that AI can consistently apply. This creates a "quality floor" across team output, freeing manager time for higher-value work while actually improving overall standards. The process of articulating your taste has its own benefit: it clarifies your own thinking and makes you more consistent. For managers drowning in feedback requests, this approach offers genuine leverage.
