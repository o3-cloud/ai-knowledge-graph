# Industrial DataOps #3: Scaling AI in Manufacturing with Andrew Waycott

**Guest:** Andrew Waycott (Co-founder, TwinThread)
**Hosts:** Willem and David (The IT/OT Insider Podcast)
**Platform:** YouTube
**Duration:** ~45 minutes
**Publication Date:** March 3, 2025

## Overview

Andrew Waycott, co-founder of TwinThread, discusses how to effectively scale AI and data analytics in manufacturing environments. The conversation covers the current state of data strategies in manufacturing, the critical importance of closed-loop systems, how to empower non-technical users to leverage data, and the roadblocks organizations face during digital transformation. Key themes: organizational strategy matters more than technology, closed-loop systems drive value, and standardization enables scaling.

## The Journey of TwinThread

### Origin and Mission

**Background:**
TwinThread founded to address manufacturing's data and AI challenges.

**Problem identified:**
Manufacturing has data; struggles to extract value from it.

**Solution:**
Platform enabling non-technical users to leverage industrial data effectively.

### The Platform Approach

**Philosophy:**
Data and AI should be accessible to operations teams, not just data scientists.

**Implementation:**
- Intuitive interfaces for non-technical users
- Automatic data integration
- Simplified analytics
- Actionable insights

**Impact:**
Empower plant managers and operators to use data without technical expertise.

## The Current State of Data Strategy in Manufacturing

### The Reality

**Situation:**
Most manufacturing companies lack coherent data strategies.

**Characteristic issues:**
- Data scattered across systems
- No unified view of operations
- Difficulty extracting insights
- Limited data utilization

**Consequence:**
Significant value left on table.

### Why Strategy Matters

**Key insight:**
Technology without strategy fails.

**Reality:**
Good strategy with average technology > great technology without strategy.

**Manufacturing challenge:**
Decades of legacy systems create complexity.

### Elements of Successful Strategy

**1. Clear Goals**
- What outcomes desired?
- What problems to solve?
- What metrics matter?

**2. Organizational Buy-in**
- Executive support
- Department alignment
- User acceptance
- Champions identified

**3. Data Foundation**
- Systems integration
- Data quality
- Accessibility
- Governance

**4. Capability Building**
- Training and education
- Tool selection
- Process change
- Continuous improvement

## Closed-Loop Systems: The Critical Component

### What Is a Closed-Loop System?

**Definition:**
System where data → insights → action → outcome measurement → iteration.

**Components:**
```
Collect data
    ↓
Analyze and model
    ↓
Generate recommendations
    ↓
Execute actions
    ↓
Measure outcomes
    ↓
Learn and iterate
    ↓
(back to collect)
```

**Key difference:**
Closed-loop = actionable insights that drive behavior change.

### Why Manufacturing Needs Closed-Loop

**Traditional approach:**
Report generation (dashboards, KPIs).

**Problem:**
Reports don't automatically change behavior.

**Closed-loop approach:**
Insights → actions → measured outcomes → continuous improvement.

**Result:**
Systematic improvement, not random variations.

### Implementation Challenge

**The gap:**
Most manufacturing organizations are not at closed-loop yet.

**Current state:**
Many still at data collection phase; some at basic analytics.

**Path forward:**
Gradually implement closed-loop for critical processes first.

## Defining Scalability in Industrial Data

### What Scalability Means

**Not just size:**
Scalability in manufacturing data means organizational capability.

**Components:**

**Technical scalability:**
- Systems handle data volume
- Performance remains acceptable
- Infrastructure grows with needs

**Organizational scalability:**

**Solution:**
- Strong executive leadership
- Clear value demonstration
- Champion networks
- Gradual adoption

## Red Flags in Customer Engagement

### Warning Signs Waycott Observes

**Red Flag 1: Lack of Executive Sponsorship**
**Indicator:**
Decision made at operational level without executive buy-in.

**Problem:**
When adoption requires behavior change, without executive support it fails.

**Resolution:**
Ensure executive commitment before starting.

**Red Flag 2: No Clear Success Definition**
**Indicator:**
Vague goals like "improve efficiency" without metrics.

**Problem:**
Can't determine if effort is successful.

**Resolution:**
Define specific, measurable success criteria upfront.

**Red Flag 3: Technology-First Thinking**
**Indicator:**
"Let's buy the best tool and see what we can do."

**Problem:**
Technology doesn't determine success; strategy does.

**Resolution:**
Strategy first, then technology selection.

**Red Flag 4: Isolated Initiatives**
**Indicator:**
One plant doing DataOps while others don't.

**Problem:**
Prevents learning transfer and scaling.

**Resolution:**
Coordinate across organization; learn from each site.

**Red Flag 5: Expecting Quick ROI**
**Indicator:**
Expecting major returns in first few months.

**Problem:**
Organizational change takes time.

**Resolution:**
Plan for 6-12 month improvement curve.

## Roadblocks in Digitalization Initiatives

### Advancement Strategy

**Don't try to jump levels.**
Each level builds on previous.

**Progression:**
1. Get data accessible
2. Build basic reports
3. Add analytics
4. Close the loop
5. Build learning systems

## Key Insights

### Technology Enablement, Not Determination

**Reality:**
Good strategy + average technology > great technology + bad strategy.

**Manufacturing implication:**
Your data strategy matters far more than tool selection.

### Closed-Loop Systems Drive Value

**Insight:**
Mere reporting doesn't create change; closed loops do.

**Requirement:**
Insights → action → measurement → iteration.

### Non-Technical Users Are Key

**Reality:**
Your operators and managers understand manufacturing better than any data scientist.

**Strategy:**
Empower them with tools and data.

### Champions Enable Adoption

**Learning:**
Organizational champions more effective than external consultants.

**Implementation:**
Build champion networks; let them drive adoption.

### Organizational Readiness Matters

**Truth:**
A manufacturing plant not ready for data isn't fixed by better technology.

**Requirement:**
Executive support, clear strategy, organizational buy-in.

### Standardization Is Hard but Essential

**Challenge:**
Manufacturing is variable; standardization difficult.

**Reality:**
Without it, you can't scale beyond single site.

**Solution:**
Flexible systems, configurable workflows, learning from variations.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Strategy before technology** — Data strategy determines success more than tool selection

7. **Clear success metrics essential** — Define specific, measurable goals
8. **Data quality evolving** — Accept initial imperfections; improve over time
9. **Organizational readiness first** — Culture and skills before advanced tools
10. **Scaling requires standardization** — Flexible standardization enables growth
11. **ROI takes time** — Plan for 6-12 month improvement arc
12. **Hills Pet Food demonstrates** — Real case study shows what's possible
13. **Multiple roadblocks common** — Legacy systems, skills, resistance are typical
14. **Platform approach simplifies** — TwinThread hides complexity for non-technical users
15. **ITOT.Academy available** — More comprehensive industrial DataOps training

## The Bottom Line

Andrew Waycott's insights into scaling AI and analytics in manufacturing highlight a critical truth: technology is the easy part; organizational change is hard.

The most successful manufacturing DataOps initiatives share common characteristics:
- Clear strategy aligned with business goals
- Executive sponsorship and leadership commitment
- Closed-loop systems where insights drive actions
- Empowered non-technical users
- Champions across organization
- Willingness to accept and improve data quality over time
- Patient execution (6-12 months to see major results)

The Hills Pet Food case study proves the opportunity: systematic optimization of complex manufacturing processes yields measurable, bottom-line value. But achieving that requires not just AI capabilities, but organizational alignment, clear strategies, and systematic execution.

For manufacturing organizations considering DataOps initiatives, the roadmap is clear: start with clear strategy, build executive support, identify champions, implement closed-loop systems on critical processes first, and expand as organizational capability grows.

The technology (platforms like TwinThread, tools, platforms) enables this, but it's the human and organizational factors that determine success. A manufacturing facility ready for DataOps with average tools will outperform one with great tools but lacking organizational readiness.
