# AI Katas: A Systematic Practice Framework for Modern AI Skills

**Author:** Owen Zanzal
**Platform:** GitHub + Medium
**Publication Date:** December 6, 2025
**Type:** Learning Resource and Framework
**Repository:** https://github.com/o3-cloud/ai-katas

## Overview

Owen Zanzal introduces AI Katas—a comprehensive collection of 100 structured exercises designed to develop proficiency in AI prompting and system design through deliberate, progressive practice. Rather than relying on passive learning or sporadic experimentation, AI Katas provide a systematic pathway for building AI literacy across ten core competency areas, from foundational prompt engineering to sophisticated multi-agent and multi-modal system architecture.

The framework acknowledges that AI capabilities are evolving rapidly, and practitioners need structured methods to develop competency systematically. Each kata functions as a focused practice exercise with clear success criteria, progressive difficulty levels, and explicit skill targets.

## The Need for Structured AI Practice

### Why AI Katas Matter

**The challenge:**
AI capabilities are advancing faster than our ability to build reliable mental models. Engineers, designers, and product managers need practical frameworks to develop competency at pace with technology evolution.

**Traditional learning gaps:**
- Ad hoc experimentation lacks systematic progression
- Online courses often feel theoretical or outdated
- Hands-on practice lacks clear success criteria
- No standardized progression path from novice to expert
- Individual practitioners work in isolation

**The kata approach:**
Borrowing from martial arts and programming traditions, structured exercises that isolate specific skills, provide clear objectives, and enable measurable progression.

### Why This Matters Now

**Rapid capability evolution:**
- New model releases monthly with different strengths
- Techniques from six months ago often obsolete
- Organizations need rapid upskilling
- Individual contributors need independent learning paths

**Business impact:**
Teams with AI fluency ship faster, make better architectural decisions, and recover faster from failures.

## The AI Katas Framework

### Core Philosophy

**Deliberate practice at scale:**
Each kata isolates a specific skill, provides clear success criteria, and enables iteration toward mastery. Combined into progressive sets, they create a learning journey from fundamentals to advanced techniques.

**Principles:**
1. **Small units** — Each kata focuses on one skill
2. **Focused objectives** — Clear success criteria (output matches expected format/quality)
3. **Progressive complexity** — Difficulty increases gradually across sets
4. **Immediate feedback** — You know immediately if you succeeded
5. **Reproducibility** — Same kata, different model = different result (valuable for understanding models)

### The 100 Katas Structure

**Five progressive sets:**

```
Set 1: Core Fundamentals (Katas 1-20)
├── Basic prompt refinement
├── Few-shot learning techniques
├── Instruction following
└── Foundation reasoning

Set 2: Advanced Techniques (Katas 21-40)
├── Prompt optimization
├── Scenario simulation
├── Model behavior critique
└── Reasoning chain design

Set 3: Specialized Skills (Katas 41-60)
├── Terminology extraction
├── Logical fallacy detection
├── Pipeline and workflow design
└── Domain-specific reasoning

Set 4: Problem-Solving & Reasoning (Katas 61-80)
├── Keyword-driven generation
├── Contradiction detection
├── Strategy development
└── Multi-step planning

Set 5: Robustness & Cognitive Skills (Katas 81-100)
├── Context boundary handling
├── Cause-effect mapping
├── Adversarial prompt defense
└── Complex multi-modal systems
```

### Difficulty Tiers

Each kata organized into four difficulty levels distributed across all 100:

- **🟢 Beginner (25 katas)** — Fundamentals, simple tasks, straightforward success criteria
- **🟡 Intermediate (25 katas)** — More complex reasoning, edge cases, multi-step processes
- **🔴 Advanced (25 katas)** — Sophisticated systems, error handling, nuanced reasoning
- **⚫ Expert (25 katas)** — Multi-agent systems, emergent behaviors, complex optimization

## Key Insights and Principles

### Deliberate Practice Over Passive Learning

**Understanding:**
Knowledge comes from focused, intentional practice with clear objectives and immediate feedback—not from passive reading or video watching.

**Application:**
Each kata isolates a skill with measurable success criteria. You know immediately if you succeeded, enabling rapid iteration.

### Model Differences Are Educational

**Key insight:**
Same kata, different models = different results. This teaches what's model-specific vs. universal in AI behavior.

**Practical value:**
Building mental models of model strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate use cases.

### Progression Matters

**Understanding:**
Skills build on each other. Mastering fundamentals enables advanced techniques.

**Implementation:**
Katas organized by both skill domain and difficulty level, enabling appropriate progression.

### Community Learning Accelerates Growth

**Principle:**
Sharing approaches, discussing tradeoffs, and learning from peers accelerates development of shared mental models.

**Mechanism:**
Team competitions, shared solutions, and discussion forums enable learning from collective experience.

### Measurement Drives Improvement

**Insight:**
Clear success criteria and progress tracking enable deliberate improvement and prevent stagnation.

**Application:**
Each kata has explicit criteria; progress is measurable across sets, difficulty levels, and domains.

## The Bottom Line

Owen Zanzal's AI Katas framework addresses a critical gap in AI education: the lack of systematic, structured practice for building AI proficiency at scale.

**The core insight:**
AI capabilities are evolving rapidly, but practitioners lack clear pathways for deliberate skill development. Borrowing from martial arts traditions, systematic exercises with clear objectives, progressive difficulty, and immediate feedback enable efficient capability building.

**The framework provides:**
- 100 structured exercises spanning fundamentals to multi-agent systems
- Clear difficulty progression and skill mappings
- Multiple engagement models (daily practice, team training, curriculum design)
- Community contribution framework for domain-specific extensions
- Practical focus on real-world competencies (prompt engineering, reasoning, multi-agent design, error handling, creativity)

**For practitioners:**
AI Katas offer a self-directed learning pathway—from fundamentals to sophisticated system design—with measurable progress and peer learning opportunities.

**For teams:**
Team training and skill assessment across the framework enables collective capability development with shared mental models and vocabulary.

**For organizations:**
Custom learning curricula using katas as building blocks, with domain-specific packs for industry-specific requirements.

**Strategic importance:**
As AI capabilities become table stakes for engineering teams, organizations that systematically develop AI literacy across their teams will have significant competitive advantage. AI Katas provide the infrastructure for that systematic development.

The framework is open-source, community-extensible, and designed to evolve as AI capabilities and organizational needs change. It shifts AI education from passive consumption to active, deliberate practice—the only proven path to real mastery.
