# Can You Prove AI ROI in Software Engineering? (Stanford 120k Devs Study)

**Speaker:** Yegor Denisov-Blanch, Researcher at Stanford
**Channel:** AI Engineer
**Upload Date:** December 11, 2025

## Overview

You're investing millions in AI for software engineering. But can you prove it's paying off?

While benchmarks show models can write code, in enterprise deployments ROI is hard to measure, easy to bias, and often distorted by activity metrics (PR counts, DORA) that say "more" without proving "better."

## Research Foundation

Drawing on field data from **120k+ developers across 600+ companies**, this talk reveals:
- Exactly where AI helps the most
- Why identical tools deliver ~0% lift in some organizations and 25%+ in others
- How to measure the ROI of software engineering AI deployments

## Key Topics

1. **The Research Approach** — Time series and cross-sectional data from ML Panels of Experts
2. **Performance Drivers** — Usage vs. quality factors that impact outcomes
3. **Codebase Entropy & AI Trust** — Managing environment cleanliness and code quality
4. **AI Engineering Practices Benchmark** — Fingerprinting top-performing teams
5. **Measurement Challenges** — Why business outcome metrics often fail to capture AI impact
6. **Proposed Framework** — Usage and outcome metrics with guardrails

## Practical Takeaway

Attendees leave with a step-by-step ROI playbook:
- What metrics to track
- Common measurement traps to avoid
- Habits top-quartile teams use to maximize AI value
