# Taste is the New Intelligence

**Author:** Stepfanie Tyler
**Publication:** BAD GIRL MEDIA
**Publication Date:** April 23, 2025

## Overview

An argument that in the AI era of infinite content, the ability to curate and discern quality has replaced traditional markers of intelligence. When AI exceeds human knowledge and information is universally accessible, selection becomes the frontier.

## The Core Argument

### "Curation is the new IQ test"

**Old intelligence:** Accumulation
- Memorizing facts
- Accessing rare information
- Breadth of knowledge
- Information as scarce resource

**New intelligence:** Selection
- Discerning quality
- Choosing what matters
- Curating amid abundance
- Attention as scarce resource

## The Shift

### Why Traditional Metrics Fail

| Old World | New World |
|-----------|-----------|
| Information scarce | Information infinite |
| Knowledge is power | Selection is power |
| Access differentiates | Judgment differentiates |
| Accumulation valued | Curation valued |

### What Changed

**AI exceeds human knowledge:**
- No human can out-memorize AI
- Raw recall commoditized
- Information access universal
- Quantity no longer differentiates

**The frontier moved:**
- From having information
- To knowing what matters
- From accumulation
- To discernment

## What Real Taste Means

### Beyond Trends

**Taste ≠ following trends**
**Taste ≠ having opinions**
**Taste ≠ consuming more**

### Coherence and Clarity

**Real taste is:**
- Coherence in choices
- Clarity about what matters
- Consistency in values
- Signal amid noise

### How Taste Manifests

It reflects how someone thinks through:
- What they consume
- What they amplify
- What they ignore
- What they create

## Attention as Currency

### The New Scarcity

**Abundant:** Content, information, options
**Scarce:** Attention, focus, consideration

### Choices as Windows

Personal consumption choices become:
- Windows into cognition
- Demonstrations of judgment
- Evidence of discernment
- Signals of sophistication

### What Your Choices Reveal

Not what you know, but:
- How you think
- What you value
- Where you focus
- What you filter

## Practical Implications

### In Digital Excess

**Sophistication signals through:**
- Restraint, not breadth
- Selection, not accumulation
- Depth, not coverage
- Thoughtfulness, not trend-following

### The New Differentiator

When everyone can access everything:
- What you choose reveals thinking
- What you ignore shows discipline
- What you amplify demonstrates values
- What you create reflects judgment

## For AI Era Work

### Relevance to AI-Assisted Development

**Applies to:**
- Tool selection
- Framework choices
- Feature prioritization
- Quality standards

**The parallel:**
- AI generates infinite code options
- Taste determines what ships
- Curation becomes engineering judgment
- Selection differentiates quality

### Taste in Technical Context

**Technical taste means:**
- Knowing what "good" looks like
- Choosing appropriate complexity
- Selecting right abstractions
- Recognizing elegant solutions

## Key Takeaways

1. **Curation = IQ test** — Selection replaces accumulation
2. **Information commoditized** — AI exceeds human recall
3. **Attention is scarce** — The new currency
4. **Taste = coherence** — Not trend-following
5. **Choices reveal cognition** — Windows into thinking
6. **Restraint signals sophistication** — Less can be more
7. **Selection differentiates** — In infinite abundance

## The Bottom Line

When AI can generate infinite content and information is universally accessible, the frontier of intelligence shifts from accumulation to selection. Taste—the ability to discern what matters amid noise—becomes the new differentiator. This isn't about following trends or having opinions; it's about coherence and clarity in choices. Personal consumption and curation decisions become windows into cognition itself, revealing how someone thinks rather than what they know. In the AI era, restraint and thoughtful selection signal sophisticated thinking more effectively than breadth of knowledge ever could. "Curation is the new IQ test."
