# Martin Fowler on Preparing for AI's Nondeterministic Computing

**Article:** Martin Fowler on Preparing for AI's Nondeterministic Computing
**Source:** The New Stack
**Author:** Martin Fowler
**Published:** 2025

## Overview

As AI systems become increasingly prevalent in software development and deployment, engineers face a fundamental shift: traditional deterministic computing paradigms no longer guarantee predictable outcomes. This article explores how software engineering practices must evolve to account for nondeterministic AI behavior.

## Key Topics

- Nondeterministic behavior in AI systems
- Software engineering practices for AI reliability
- Testing and verification strategies for AI-driven code
- Architectural considerations for AI integration
- Risk management in nondeterministic systems

## Relevance to Our Project

This article is particularly relevant for AI Shoplogix:
- Addresses challenges of running AI agents autonomously
- Discusses testing strategies for unpredictable AI outputs
- Explores architectural patterns for reliability
- Informs our approach to agent safety and validation

## Related Concepts

- AI reliability and robustness
- Testing nondeterministic systems
- AI governance and oversight
- Software engineering best practices for AI era
