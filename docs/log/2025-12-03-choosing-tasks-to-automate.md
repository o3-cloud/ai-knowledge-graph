# How to Choose Which Tasks to Automate with AI (+50 Real Examples)

**Author:** Teresa Torres
**Publication:** Product Talk
**Publication Date:** December 3, 2025

## Overview

Rather than automating everything possible, Teresa Torres advocates a selective approach to AI workflow investment. The framework helps identify which tasks deserve automation effort based on strategic objectives and practical criteria.

## Core Philosophy

**Don't automate everything—automate strategically.**

The goal isn't maximum automation but maximum value from automation investments. Some tasks shouldn't be automated; others benefit from AI augmentation rather than full automation.

## Three Primary Objectives

### 1. Amplifying Existing Strengths

Use AI to do more of what you're already good at.

**Examples:**
- Writer who's strong at research → AI-assisted research expansion
- Good at synthesis → AI helps gather more inputs to synthesize
- Strong communicator → AI handles formatting/distribution

**Key insight:** AI multiplies existing capabilities rather than creating new ones.

### 2. Reducing Friction

Eliminate repetitive, tedious steps in frequently performed tasks.

**Characteristics of high-friction tasks:**
- Done repeatedly (daily, weekly)
- Involve mechanical steps
- Follow predictable patterns
- Time-consuming relative to value

**Examples:**
- Formatting documents
- Data entry and organization
- Scheduling and coordination
- Status updates and reports

### 3. Removing Energy Drains

Automate or augment tasks that deplete motivation.

**Energy drain indicators:**
- Procrastination triggers
- Tasks you'd delegate if possible
- Activities that leave you tired
- Work that feels like a slog

**Key insight:** Even if a task is quick, if it drains energy, consider automation.

## Seven Decision Questions

Evaluate potential AI workflows by asking:

### 1. Is this recurring or one-time?

- **Recurring:** Worth workflow investment
- **One-time:** Probably not worth building automation

### 2. Do you enjoy it or would you delegate it?

- **Enjoy:** Consider augmentation (AI assists, you stay involved)
- **Would delegate:** Consider automation (AI handles it)

### 3. What's the complexity level?

- **Simple/mechanical:** Good automation candidate
- **Complex/nuanced:** Better for augmentation or paired work

### 4. Can you explain the process step-by-step?

- **Yes, clearly:** Automatable
- **No, tacit knowledge:** Requires human involvement

### 5. Does it require human judgment?

- **Yes:** Augmentation or paired work
- **No:** Full automation possible

### 6. Can you define success measurably?

- **Yes:** Can validate AI output
- **No:** Harder to trust automation

### 7. What's the risk if executed poorly?

- **Low risk:** Safe to automate
- **High risk:** Keep human oversight

## Three Implementation Approaches

### Automation

**Definition:** Tasks fully handled by AI with minimal human involvement.

**Characteristics:**
- Well-defined inputs and outputs
- Predictable process
- Low-stakes if imperfect
- Recurring frequently

**Example:** Daily research digest generation
- AI scans sources
- Filters relevant content
- Generates summary
- Delivers to inbox

### Augmentation

**Definition:** AI assists but you retain oversight and final control.

**Characteristics:**
- Requires human judgment at key points
- Benefits from AI speed/scale
- Output needs review before use
- Stakes warrant verification

**Example:** Podcast episode editing and metadata
- AI generates transcript
- AI suggests edit points
- AI drafts show notes
- Human reviews and refines

### Paired Work

**Definition:** Collaborative human-AI iteration throughout the task.

**Characteristics:**
- Creative or complex work
- Benefits from back-and-forth
- Human adds judgment throughout
- Neither could do it as well alone

**Example:** Pair-writing articles with Claude
- Human provides direction
- AI drafts sections
- Human refines and redirects
- Iterative improvement

## Decision Matrix

| Task Type | Recurring? | Enjoy? | Complex? | Risk? | Approach |
|-----------|------------|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| Data entry | Yes | No | Low | Low | Automate |
| Research | Yes | Yes | Medium | Low | Augment |
| Writing | Yes | Yes | High | Medium | Paired work |
| Scheduling | Yes | No | Low | Low | Automate |
| Strategy | Varies | Yes | High | High | Paired work |
| Formatting | Yes | No | Low | Low | Automate |

## Real-World Implementation Examples

Torres shares 40+ personal workflows across domains:

### Writing
- Research gathering and synthesis
- Draft generation and iteration
- Editing and refinement
- Formatting and publishing

### Research
- Daily news/content monitoring
- Source discovery and curation
- Note organization and linking
- Pattern identification

### Podcasting
- Transcript generation
- Show notes creation
- Clip identification
- Metadata generation

### Administrative
- Email triage and response
- Calendar management
- Task organization
- Status reporting

## Tools Mentioned

- **Claude Code:** Complex workflows and automation
- **Obsidian:** Note-taking and knowledge management
- **Trello:** Task and project organization
- **Descript:** Audio/video editing

## Key Principles

### Start with Objectives, Not Tools

Don't ask "What can AI do?" Ask "What do I want to accomplish?"

### Invest Proportionally

Time spent building automation should match:
- Frequency of task
- Time saved per occurrence
- Energy/friction reduced

### Iterate on Workflows

First version won't be perfect. Plan to:
- Test and observe
- Identify failure modes
- Refine based on experience

### Maintain Appropriate Oversight

Match oversight level to risk:
- Low risk → Trust automation
- Medium risk → Spot-check outputs
- High risk → Review everything

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Over-Automating

Not everything should be automated:
- Tasks you enjoy doing
- Work that builds skills you want
- Activities that provide insight

### Under-Investing in Setup

Effective automation requires upfront work:
- Clear process definition
- Quality prompt engineering
- Testing and validation

### Ignoring Maintenance

Workflows need ongoing attention:
- Contexts change
- Tools update
- Requirements evolve

## Key Takeaways

1. **Be selective:** Automate strategically, not comprehensively
2. **Know your objectives:** Amplify strengths, reduce friction, remove energy drains
3. **Ask the seven questions:** Recurring? Enjoyable? Complex? Explainable? Judgment needed? Measurable? Risky?
4. **Choose the right approach:** Automation, augmentation, or paired work
5. **Match investment to value:** Frequent, tedious, draining tasks deserve most attention
6. **Iterate:** Workflows improve with use and refinement

## The Bottom Line

The question isn't "Can AI do this?" but "Should AI do this, and how much should I stay involved?"

Strategic task selection—based on clear objectives and honest assessment—yields far better results than attempting to automate everything possible.
