# Fast vs. Slow AI

**Author:** Daniel Miessler
**Publication:** danielmiessler.com

## Overview

A nuanced perspective on AI adoption that challenges Silicon Valley's optimization ethos. The central insight: some activities shouldn't be optimized because their value *is* the difficulty. Not everything should be delegated to AI.

## The Core Insight

### "Be careful not to outsource work that is only useful when done yourself."

Some work generates value through the process, not just the output. Outsourcing the process eliminates the benefit.

## The Van Jones Analogy

### "We can't take the weights out of the gym"

**The metaphor:**
- Lifting weights requires personal struggle
- The difficulty IS the point
- Outsourcing the lift = no benefit
- Someone else's workout doesn't build your muscles

**Applied to AI:**
- Some cognitive work requires personal engagement
- The struggle generates the value
- AI doing the work = you missing the benefit
- Fast ≠ better for everything

## The Meaning-Suffering Connection

### A Crucial Framework

**Meaning correlates with struggle:**
- Muscle development requires microtears
- Learning requires cognitive difficulty
- Growth requires discomfort
- Mastery requires practice

**The implication:**
- Removing pain removes growth
- Optimization can destroy value
- Efficiency isn't always the goal
- Some things should be hard

## Activities at Risk

### What Shouldn't Be Outsourced

| Activity | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Reading poetry | Slow absorption creates meaning |
| Meaningful conversations | Presence is the point |
| Absorbing challenging concepts | Struggle builds understanding |
| Thinking and contemplation | The process IS the product |
| Theorizing | Personal engagement required |

### The Pattern

These represent "a lot of the stuff that matters most."

**Common thread:**
- Value from process, not just output
- Personal engagement essential
- Speed undermines purpose
- AI assistance removes benefit

## The Recommended Approach

### Strategic Bifurcation

**AI for discovery (Fast):**
- Rapidly identify valuable content
- Filter signal from noise
- Find what's worth engaging with
- Efficiency appropriate here

**Natural for learning (Slow):**
- Deliberate consumption
- Deep processing
- Personal struggle
- Meaning generation

### The Split

```
Discovery: AI-assisted, fast, efficient
    ↓
Selection: Human judgment
    ↓
Learning: Natural, slow, painful
```

### Preserve the Painful Work

The "painful work" generates:
- Genuine understanding
- Personal meaning
- Lasting growth
- Real capability

## Challenging Optimization Culture

### The Silicon Valley Default

**Assumption:** Faster is always better
**Goal:** Optimize everything
**Metric:** Efficiency
**Method:** Automate all friction

### The Counter-Argument

**Reality:** Some value requires friction
**Goal:** Appropriate engagement
**Metric:** Growth and meaning
**Method:** Strategic tool use

### What This Challenges

- "Move fast" as universal good
- Friction as always bad
- AI as universal solution
- Efficiency as highest value

## Practical Application

### Questions to Ask

Before using AI for a task:

1. **Is the output the value, or the process?**
   - Output only → AI appropriate
   - Process matters → Consider manual

2. **Will I grow from doing this myself?**
   - Growth potential → Do it yourself
   - No growth → Delegate to AI

3. **Does struggle generate meaning here?**
   - Meaning from struggle → Preserve struggle
   - No meaning connection → Optimize away

4. **Am I taking weights out of the gym?**
   - Removing beneficial difficulty → Reconsider
   - Removing wasteful friction → Proceed

### The Bifurcation Test

| Task Aspect | Use AI | Do Yourself |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Finding content | ✓ | |
| Filtering options | ✓ | |
| Learning content | | ✓ |
| Deep understanding | | ✓ |
| Boilerplate creation | ✓ | |
| Creative thinking | | ✓ |
| Research discovery | ✓ | |
| Synthesis and meaning | | ✓ |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't outsource growth** — Some work only valuable when done yourself
2. **Weights in the gym** — Can't delegate beneficial struggle
3. **Meaning = struggle** — Removing difficulty removes value
4. **Bifurcate strategically** — AI for discovery, natural for learning
5. **Question optimization** — Faster isn't always better
6. **Preserve painful work** — It generates understanding and meaning
7. **Value ≠ output** — Sometimes process IS the product

## The Bottom Line

Miessler offers essential nuance in the AI adoption conversation. The default assumption—that AI should optimize everything—misses a crucial category of human activity where value comes from the process, not the output. Reading poetry, thinking deeply, learning challenging concepts—these generate meaning precisely because they're difficult. "We can't take the weights out of the gym." The recommended approach: use AI for fast discovery and filtering, but preserve natural, slow engagement for learning and growth. Some things should remain hard. Not everything should be optimized. The struggle is often the point.
