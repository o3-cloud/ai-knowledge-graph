# JustHTML Is a Fascinating Example of Vibe Engineering in Action

## The Project

JustHTML is a Python HTML parser library created by Emil Stenström using AI-assisted development. It demonstrates "vibe engineering" in practice—experienced developers strategically leveraging coding agents rather than blindly generating code.

## Impressive Results

The project achieved remarkable outcomes:
- **9,200+** official HTML5 conformance tests passing
- **100%** test coverage
- **3,000** lines of implementation code

## Engineering Discipline

Stenström's approach combined AI assistance with professional software engineering practices:

1. **Conformance Testing** — Integrated official HTML5 test suites early
2. **API Design** — Made intentional, deliberate design decisions upfront
3. **Performance** — Benchmarked and optimized the parser
4. **Refactoring** — Refactored from scratch multiple times to improve quality
5. **Fuzzing** — Used fuzzing to identify and harden edge cases

## The Critical Distinction

Stenström "spent a lot of time reviewing code, making design decisions" while "the agent did the typing."

This represents a mature division of labor:
- **Human expertise:** Architecture, design decisions, strategic direction, code review
- **AI assistance:** Implementation details, typing, routine code generation

## Key Insight

This model demonstrates the professional alternative to unreviewed, prototype-level AI code generation. It's not about blindly accepting agent output—it's about strategically directing agent effort toward well-defined architectural goals while maintaining human oversight and decision-making authority.
