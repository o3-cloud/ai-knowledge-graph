# Andrej Karpathy: Software Is Changing (Again)

**Speaker:** Andrej Karpathy
**Event:** Y Combinator AI Startup School
**Date:** June 17, 2025
**Duration:** ~40 minutes

## Overview

Karpathy argues we've entered "Software 3.0" where natural language becomes the programming interface. Drawing on his work at Stanford, OpenAI, and Tesla, he explores what this shift means for developers, users, and software design—framing LLMs as a new kind of computer we're only beginning to understand.

## Software Evolution: 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0

### Software 1.0
- Traditional code written by humans
- Explicit instructions
- Deterministic behavior

### Software 2.0 (2017)
- Neural networks learn from data
- Weights as the program
- Training replaces coding for some tasks

### Software 3.0 (Now)
- **Natural language as programming interface**
- Models interpret intent
- "You program them in English"

**Key insight:** LLMs deserve a major version upgrade designation—the change is fundamental, not incremental.

## LLMs as Infrastructure

### Three Properties

**Like Utilities:**
- Distributed infrastructure
- Metered access
- Essential service

**Like Fabs:**
- Massive capital investment
- Few providers
- Economies of scale

**Like Operating Systems:**
- Platform for applications
- Resource management
- Developer ecosystem

### The New LLM OS

Historical analogy: **We're in computing circa 1960s.**

- Labs are the "fabs" building the infrastructure
- Distribution resembles early utilities
- Many historical patterns apply
- Massive opportunity space ahead

## LLM Psychology: "People Spirits"

### The Core Concept

**LLMs = stochastic simulations of people**

- Trained on human data
- Emergent psychology
- Autoregressive Transformer as simulator
- "People spirits" captured in weights

### Dual Nature

**Superhuman in some ways:**
- Vast knowledge access
- Consistent availability
- Parallel processing
- No fatigue

**Fallible in others:**
- Hallucinations
- Inconsistency
- Missing common sense
- Context limitations

### Implications

Understanding LLM psychology is essential for:
- Productive collaboration
- Appropriate task delegation
- Realistic expectations
- Effective system design

## Partial Autonomy Design

### The Spectrum

Full human control ←→ Full agent autonomy

### Lessons from Tesla Autopilot

**The autonomy slider concept:**
- Users need control over autonomy level
- Different tasks warrant different autonomy
- Trust builds incrementally
- Graceful handoff essential

### The Iron Man Analogy

**Two models for human-AI systems:**

| Model | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Augmentation** | AI enhances human capability | Iron Man suit |
| **Agents** | AI acts independently | Autonomous robot |

**Karpathy's preference:** Iron Man model—augmentation over replacement.

### Human-AI Collaboration Loops

**Critical design principle:**
- Keep humans in the loop
- AI proposes, human approves
- Iterative refinement
- Shared context

## Vibe Coding: Everyone Is a Programmer

### The Democratization

**"Everyone is now a programmer"**

Natural language programming means:
- Non-programmers can build software
- Intent replaces syntax
- Iteration through conversation
- Accessibility explosion

### What This Enables

- Rapid prototyping
- Personal tools
- Domain expert direct creation
- Reduced translation loss

### Reference: MenuGen

Karpathy's retrospective on vibe coding a real application demonstrates the approach in practice.

## Building for Agents

### The New Consumer of Digital Infrastructure

**Three consumers of digital information:**

1. **GUIs** — for humans
2. **APIs** — for programs
3. **Agents** — for LLMs (NEW)

### Future-Ready Infrastructure

**Build for agents now:**
- Agent-readable formats
- Structured data exposure
- Action-oriented interfaces
- Machine-navigable content

### Why This Matters

Agents will become primary consumers and manipulators of digital information—infrastructure that serves them will win.

## Key Timestamps

| Time | Topic |
|------|-------|
| 01:25 | Software evolution: 1.0 to 3.0 |
| 04:40 | Programming in English |
| 06:10 | LLMs as utilities, fabs, and OS |
| 11:04 | The new LLM OS |
| 14:39 | Psychology of LLMs: "People spirits" |
| 18:22 | Designing with partial autonomy |
| 23:40 | Human-AI collaboration loops |
| 26:00 | Lessons from Tesla Autopilot |
| 27:52 | Iron Man analogy |
| 29:06 | Vibe coding |
| 33:39 | Building for agents |
| 38:14 | Summary: We're in the 1960s of LLMs |

## Three Opportunities

### 1. Partial Autonomy Products
LLMs as "people spirits" → build products with adjustable autonomy levels

### 2. Accessible Software Creation
LLMs programmed in English → vibe coding makes software highly accessible

### 3. Agent-First Infrastructure
LLMs as new primary digital consumers → build for agents

## Key Takeaways

1. **Software 3.0** — natural language as programming interface
2. **LLM OS emerging** — we're in the 1960s of this paradigm
3. **"People spirits"** — LLMs have emergent psychology from human data
4. **Dual nature** — superhuman AND fallible simultaneously
5. **Iron Man model** — augmentation preferred over full agents
6. **Autonomy sliders** — users control the level of AI independence
7. **Vibe coding** — everyone becomes a programmer
8. **Build for agents** — they're the new primary digital consumers

## The Bottom Line

Karpathy frames the current moment as the 1960s of LLM computing—early days with massive opportunity. Software 3.0 represents a fundamental shift where natural language becomes the programming interface. LLMs are "people spirits"—stochastic simulations with emergent psychology that are simultaneously superhuman and fallible. The winning approach combines human judgment with AI capability (Iron Man model) rather than full autonomy. Three opportunities emerge: partial autonomy products, democratized software creation through vibe coding, and building infrastructure for the coming agent economy. The message is clear: time to build.
