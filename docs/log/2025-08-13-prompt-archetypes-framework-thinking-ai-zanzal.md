# Prompt Archetypes: A Framework to Think With AI

**Author:** Owen Zanzal
**Platform:** Medium (DevOps+AI)
**Publication Date:** August 13, 2025
**Type:** Practical Framework Guide
**Duration:** 5 min read
**Key Concept:** Eight cognitive lenses for intentional AI interaction

## Overview

Owen Zanzal presents Prompt Archetypes as a framework for thinking *with* AI rather than simply using it. Rather than memorizing specific prompt templates, archetypes provide mental models—cognitive lenses that guide the type of thinking you need from AI at any moment. Each archetype shifts the AI's behavior to unlock different kinds of collaboration and insight.

The framework transforms prompting from technical execution to intentional practice: matching your current need (clarity, momentum, ideas, critique, planning, reflection) to the right cognitive mode.

## The Core Problem: The Blank Page

### Why Starting Is Hard

**The challenge:**
When opening a blank chat, users face:
- Uncertainty about what to ask
- Unclear what kind of answer they need
- Not knowing how to frame the request
- The intimidating blank page

### The Solution: Cognitive Lenses

**Archetypes provide:**
- A starting point when stuck
- Shared language for intentional prompting
- System for moving from raw output to insight
- Way to match your state to right collaboration mode

**Result:**
Transforms AI from tool to thinking partner.

## The Eight Core Archetypes

### 1. The Interviewer

**Goal:** Gather context through thoughtful questions

**Purpose:**
Help you think out loud by asking clarifying questions, one at a time.

**Use cases:**
- Project scoping
- Requirements gathering
- Self-reflection
- Complex problem exploration

**How to invoke:**
> "Ask me whatever you need to understand this project before we begin."

**Strength:**
Forces clarity through dialogue rather than assumption.

**Tip:** Ask it to summarize what it's learned so far. This helps overcome its lack of persistent memory.

**When to use:**
Starting point when unsure how to begin or planning something complex.

### 2. The Creator

**Goal:** Spark ideas and reframe concepts

**Purpose:**
Generate novel perspectives, unexpected angles, creative recombinations.

**Use cases:**
- Brainstorming
- Metaphor generation
- Creative exploration
- Stuck situations needing fresh perspective

**How to invoke:**
> "Give me 10 unexpected analogies to explain cloud computing."

**Strength:**
Excels at surprising you with unconventional connections.

**Tip:** Use it to explore "too weird to pitch" ideas — you might find gold in the absurd.

**When to use:**
When facing ideation blocks or need novel framings.

### 3. The Doer

**Goal:** Execute tasks and transform formats

**Purpose:**
Convert, structure, format, and execute mechanical work.

**Use cases:**
- Summarizing documents
- Converting formats
- Formatting output
- Translating between domains
- Data transformation

**How to invoke:**
> "Turn this transcript into a structured summary."

**Strength:**
Most efficient at "getting stuff done" and producing tangible output.

**Tip:** Pair the Doer with the Challenger or Coach to improve output quality and catch shallow results.

**When to use:**
Task-oriented work requiring format transformation or mechanical execution.

### 4. The Expert

**Goal:** Provide informed explanations from a defined role

**Purpose:**
Simulate specific domain knowledge and specialized perspectives.

**Use cases:**
- Teaching
- Technical deep dives
- Domain-specific advice
- Specialized perspectives

**How to invoke:**
> "You are a senior DevOps engineer. Explain this architecture pattern."

**Strength:**
Provides domain-informed perspective tailored to specific expertise.

**Tip:** Don't assume expertise — test its output. Ask follow-ups or pair with the Challenger.

**When to use:**
Need perspective from specific domain or role.

### 5. The Challenger

**Goal:** Identify weaknesses and pressure-test ideas

**Purpose:**
Play the skeptical peer, expose blind spots, simulate opposition.

**Use cases:**
- Critical review
- Red teaming
- Contrarian thinking
- Risk analysis
- Weakness identification

**How to invoke:**
> "Why might this fail? What am I missing?"

**Strength:**
Forces rigorous thinking by pressuring assumptions.

**Tip:** Combine with the Expert or Strategist for robust planning and risk analysis.

**When to use:**
Before important decisions or when confidence feels high.

### 6. The Strategist (Planner)

**Goal:** Coordinate actions and evaluate options

**Purpose:**
Synthesize complexity into actionable plans with clear sequencing.

**Use cases:**
- Planning
- Prioritizing
- Decision support
- Orchestrating workstreams
- Timeline development

**How to invoke:**
> "Help me break this into phases with priorities and dependencies."

**Strength:**
Orchestrates complexity into coherent plans.

**Tip:** Anchor with constraints. The more context (timelines, goals, limitations), the better.

**When to use:**
Need to synthesize complexity into coordinated action.

### 7. The Coach

**Goal:** Offer feedback to improve communication or performance

**Purpose:**
Critique, refine, and elevate work toward excellence.

**Use cases:**
- Writing reviews
- Practicing presentations
- Tone adjustment
- Performance improvement
- Communication refinement

**How to invoke:**
> "Review this draft and suggest improvements for clarity and impact."

**Strength:**
Helps you refine and elevate output toward your standards.

**Tip:** Feed personal context to avoid generic advice. Ask for examples, rewrites, or alternate tones.

**When to use:**
Polishing and refining work before sharing or execution.

### 8. The Reflector

**Goal:** Help process feelings and uncover insights

**Purpose:**
Facilitate self-inquiry and deeper understanding of blocks and motivations.

**Use cases:**
- Personal retrospectives
- Goal-setting
- Identifying sources of blockage
- Motivation exploration
- Perspective shifting

**How to invoke:**
> "Guide me through what's really frustrating me about this project."

**Strength:**
Helps externalize and process internal states.

**Tip:** Request deeper questions or perspective shifts — e.g., "What would my future self say about this?"

**When to use:**
Feeling blocked or unclear on your own thinking.

## The Navigational Mindset

### Five-Step Framework for Using Archetypes

#### Step 1: Start with Awareness

**Ask yourself:**
- Do I need clarity or momentum?
- Do I want ideas, structure, critique, or insight?
- Am I trying to start, build, fix, or reflect?

**Your answer points to the archetype.**

#### Step 2: Choose a Role, Not a Prompt

**Key distinction:**
You're not "writing a good prompt." You're inviting a mode of thinking.

**Matching need to archetype:**

```
Need direction? → Interviewer
Need ideas? → Creator
Need execution? → Doer
Need understanding? → Expert
Need to test something? → Challenger
Need to plan? → Strategist
Need polish? → Coach
Need clarity on your own thoughts? → Reflector
```

**Implementation:**
Don't announce the archetype. Just prompt in that spirit.

#### Step 3: Switch Without Ceremony

**Switch when:**
- You feel stuck
- The tone feels off
- The output feels too shallow or too smart
- You notice your needs have changed

**How to switch:**
Simply change your questions without naming the shift.

> "Now push back on this." (Challenger)
> "Now polish this like a senior writer." (Coach)
> "Now help me step back and unpack what's blocking me." (Reflector)

**Flow:**
Archetype switching follows your mental state naturally.

#### Step 4: Use Archetypes to Mirror Yourself

**The insight:**
Sometimes the AI doesn't need to do anything new—you do.

**Matching your state to archetype:**

```
Overwhelmed → Interviewer (gather clarity)
Blank → Creator (spark ideas)
Spinning → Reflector (process internally)
Overconfident → Challenger (pressure-test)
Chaotic → Strategist (organize)
Rough → Coach (refine)
```

**Effect:**
Archetype choice shifts your own lens on the problem.

#### Step 5: Think of Archetypes as Threads, Not Tools

**Key distinction:**
They're not presets or templates. They're trails of intent.

**How to use:**
- You don't need all eight
- Just enough to move forward
- Switch between as needed
- Follow the thread of intention

## The Core Archetypes Condensed

### Memorable Sequence

If you can remember these eight actions:
- Ask
- Create
- Do
- Explain
- Challenge
- Plan
- Improve
- Reflect

Then you already know the archetypes. Use the one that matches your moment, then switch when the moment changes.

## How Archetypes Enable Thinking With AI

### From Tool to Practice

**Traditional approach:**
- Use AI as task executor
- Feed prompt, get output
- Move on

**Archetype approach:**
- Use AI as thinking partner
- Match archetype to need
- Iterate through modes
- Build understanding together

### The Rhythm of Collaboration

**Natural sequence:**

```
Awareness (what do I need?)
    ↓
Activation (which archetype?)
    ↓
Iteration (switch as needed)
    ↓
Integration (move to action or next phase)
```

### Matching Lifecycle Phases

| Phase | Primary Archetype | Secondary | Tertiary |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Starting** | Interviewer | Creator | Reflector |
| **Building** | Doer | Expert | Strategist |
| **Testing** | Challenger | Coach | Expert |
| **Refining** | Coach | Challenger | Doer |
| **Implementing** | Strategist | Doer | Coach |
| **Reflecting** | Reflector | Interviewer | Coach |

## Why Archetypes Work

### 1. They Match Your Mental State

Each archetype aligns with a specific cognitive mode:
- Clarity → Interviewer, Reflector
- Momentum → Creator, Doer
- Confidence → Strategist, Challenger
- Refinement → Coach

### 2. They Reduce Decision Friction

No longer "what should I ask?" Instead: "what mode do I need?"

**Benefit:**
Faster context switching, clearer direction.

### 3. They Enable Context Switching

Allows rapid pivoting between thinking modes without re-explaining.

**Flow:**
Same conversation, different lenses applied sequentially.

### 4. They Make Thinking Visible

Naming the archetype makes your cognitive process explicit and reviewable.

**Transparency:**
You can see what kind of thinking you're doing at each step.

## Common Patterns

### The Discovery Sequence

```
Interviewer (clarify problem)
    ↓
Creator (explore possibilities)
    ↓
Challenger (pressure-test)
    ↓
Strategist (plan)
```

### The Execution Sequence

```
Strategist (plan)
    ↓
Doer (execute)
    ↓
Coach (refine)
    ↓
Expert (review)
```

### The Reflection Sequence

```
Reflector (process)
    ↓
Interviewer (clarify learning)
    ↓
Coach (integrate insights)
    ↓
Strategist (plan next)
```

## Practical Tips

### 1. Don't Over-Name

You don't need to say "act as the Interviewer." Just prompt in that spirit.

### 2. Personalize the Language

Adapt archetype invocations to your style and context.

### 3. Combine Archetypes

Stack modes: "Challenge this like a skeptic, then suggest improvements like a coach."

### 4. Match Energy to Archetype

- High energy → Creator, Challenger
- Low energy → Reflector, Interviewer
- Focused energy → Doer, Strategist

### 5. Use as Team Language

If working with others, archetype names create shared vocabulary.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Eight archetypes** — Interviewer, Creator, Doer, Expert, Challenger, Strategist, Coach, Reflector
2. **Cognitive lenses** — Each shifts how AI thinks about the problem
3. **Not templates** — They're mental models, not fixed prompts
4. **Match to need** — Choose archetype based on what you need
5. **Switch fluidly** — Change without ceremony when needs change
6. **Awareness first** — Ask what you actually need
7. **Role over technique** — Invite a thinking mode, not a response format
8. **Threads not tools** — Follow trails of intention, not preset paths
9. **Practice based** — Requires habit-building, not memorization
10. **Thinking partner** — Transforms AI from task executor to collaborator
11. **Natural sequences** — Discovery, execution, reflection patterns
12. **Transparent process** — Makes your thinking visible and intentional
13. **Reduces friction** — "What archetype?" is clearer than "what prompt?"
14. **Scalable** — Works from simple to complex tasks
15. **Team applicable** — Creates shared language for AI collaboration
16. **State dependent** — Choose based on your current cognitive state
17. **Iterative** — Cycle through archetypes as understanding develops
18. **Perspective shifting** — Archetype choice shifts your own lens
19. **Not magic words** — Requires intentional practice to be effective
20. **Co-creative** — Enables genuine partnership with model's thinking

## The Bottom Line

Owen Zanzal presents Prompt Archetypes as a navigational mindset rather than a technical framework. The eight archetypes—Interviewer, Creator, Doer, Expert, Challenger, Strategist, Coach, Reflector—function as cognitive lenses that shift how AI collaborates with you.

**The core insight:**
Intentional prompting isn't about perfect phrasing; it's about matching your current cognitive need to the right thinking mode, then switching fluidly as your needs evolve.

**The practice:**
1. Develop awareness of what you actually need
2. Match need to archetype
3. Prompt in that spirit (without announcing it)
4. Switch when your state changes
5. Let archetypes become natural rhythm of thinking

**For practitioners:**
Rather than accumulating prompt templates, develop fluency in eight mental modes. This transforms AI from task executor to genuine thinking partner—one where you control the lens, not the outcomes.

**The philosophy:**
"It's not just prompts — it's practice." Prompt Archetypes work through intentional habit-building: recognizing your cognitive state, inviting appropriate thinking mode, iterating through perspectives, and moving toward clarity and action.

The framework enables what the best thinking requires: perspective shifting, challenging assumptions, creative exploration, rigorous planning, and thoughtful reflection—all in conversation with an AI that can match your pace when guided well.
