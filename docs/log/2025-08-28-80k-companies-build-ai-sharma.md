# How 80,000 Companies Build with AI: Products as Organisms and the Death of Org Charts

**Guest:** Asha Sharma (AI Product Strategy Lead, Microsoft)
**Host:** Lenny Rachitsky (Lenny's Podcast)
**Platform:** YouTube
**Duration:** ~57 minutes
**Publication Date:** August 28, 2025

## Overview

Asha Sharma, who leads AI product strategy at Microsoft and has visibility into what's working across 15,000+ startups and enterprises, discusses how the nature of product development is fundamentally shifting. She explores the evolution from "product as artifact" to "product as organism," introduces Microsoft's innovative seasons planning framework, explains how agents are dismantling traditional org charts, and shares her vision for the "agentic society" where agents outnumber humans in organizations.

## From Product as Artifact to Product as Organism

### The Fundamental Shift

**Product as Artifact (Traditional):**
- Built once, refined iteratively
- Static functionality
- Version releases
- Relatively stable behavior
- Designed by humans, used by humans

**Product as Organism (AI Era):**
- Continuously evolving through feedback
- Dynamic behavior and adaptation
- Continuous learning
- Emergent properties
- Co-created by humans and AI

### What This Means for Builders

**Implications:**
- Stop thinking about "done"
- Embrace continuous evolution
- Design for feedback loops
- Build for adaptation
- Measure and optimize continuously

**Mental model shift:**
From "building a product" to "cultivating a system."

### Examples of Product as Organism

**Copilot:**
- Learns from usage patterns
- Improves through feedback
- Adapts to individual users
- Evolves over time
- Never truly "finished"

**Modern AI agents:**
- Get smarter with use
- Learn from outcomes
- Adapt strategies
- Improve continuously
- Emergent capabilities

## Microsoft's Seasons Planning Framework

### The Problem It Solves

**Challenge:**
Traditional planning (quarterly, yearly) doesn't work in AI era.

**Reality:**
- AI capabilities change rapidly
- Market shifts overnight
- Competitors move quickly
- Rigid planning becomes obsolete

### How Seasons Work

**Concept:**
Replace fixed quarters with flexible "seasons" aligned to capability maturity.

**Characteristics:**
- Shorter planning windows
- More flexible boundaries
- Aligned to product maturity, not calendar
- Ability to pivot quickly

**Phases:**
```
Season 1: Foundation (build core capability)
Season 2: Growth (expand and optimize)
Season 3: Maturity (stabilize and monetize)
Season 4: Evolution (prepare for next capability)
```

### Benefits

**Flexibility:**
Can move between seasons based on market reality, not calendar.

**Responsiveness:**
Adapt strategy quickly to new information.

**Alignment:**
Team understands where product is in lifecycle.

**Innovation:**
Space to experiment without rigid constraints.

### Implementation

**Key:**
Leaders need comfort with uncertainty and change.

**Requirement:**
Regular assessment of which "season" product is in.

**Action:**
Adjust strategy, resources, and goals based on season.

## The Death of the Org Chart

### How Agents Are Reshaping Organizations

**Traditional org charts:**
- Hierarchy of positions
- Fixed reporting relationships
- Role-based organization
- Vertical accountability

**Agent-powered organization:**
- Task networks
- Fluid collaboration
- Capability-based organization
- Outcome accountability

### "The Loop, Not the Lane"

**Old organizing principle:**
"The lane" — your position in hierarchy.

**New organizing principle:**
"The loop" — the feedback loop you're in.

**What this means:**
- Focus on outcomes, not positions
- Organize around feedback loops
- Collaborate based on needed skills
- Accountability to results, not position

**Example:**
Instead of "reporting to manager in lane Y," you're in "loop optimizing for customer satisfaction with agents A, B, and C."

### Task Networks vs. Hierarchies

**How it works:**
```
Traditional: CEO → VP → Manager → Individual
             (fixed roles, clear chain)

Agent era: Outcomes ← Task Network ← Agents + Humans
           (flexible, capability-based)
```

**Flexibility:**
Agents and humans form teams around specific tasks.

**Scalability:**
Easy to add agents for new tasks without org restructuring.

### Implications for Leadership

**Shift:**
From managing people to enabling agents and people to work together.

**New skill:**
Designing effective task networks and feedback loops.

**Opportunity:**
Better utilization of human creativity for high-judgment work.

## The Three-Phase Pattern

### Why Most AI Companies Fail at Phase One

**Phase 1 Challenge:**
Moving from prototype to production-quality system.

**Where failures happen:**
- Reliability issues
- Scaling problems
- Cost not viable
- Quality insufficient for real use

**Why it's hard:**
Demo impressive; production is different.

### The Three Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation and Reliability

**Goal:**
Build production-ready system.

**Challenges:**
- Reliability at scale
- Cost optimization
- Handling edge cases
- User satisfaction
- Error recovery

**Success criteria:**
- 99.X% reliability
- Economically viable
- Handles majority of cases
- Users find value
- Can scale

**Why most fail:**
Prototype vs. production gap bigger than expected.

#### Phase 2: Customization and Context

**Goal:**
Tailor to specific contexts and users.

**Capabilities:**
- Fine-tuning for specific use cases
- Learning from user behavior
- Contextual adaptation
- Domain-specific optimization

**Value:**
Moves from general to specific.

#### Phase 3: Autonomy and Scale

**Goal:**
Agents operating with minimal human intervention.

**Requirements:**
- Proven reliability
- Clear decision frameworks
- Effective feedback loops
- Trust in systems

**Outcome:**
Systems that improve and scale without human intervention.

## Post-Training Will See More Investment Than Pre-Training

### The Shift in Focus

**Current state:**
Most investment in pre-training (building foundation models).

**Future:**
Post-training becoming center of gravity.

**Why:**
Pre-training increasingly done (models exist); differentiation in post-training.

### What Post-Training Includes

**Fine-tuning:**
Training on specific tasks or domains.

**Reinforcement Learning:**
Learning from feedback and outcomes.

**Alignment:**
Training to behave as desired.

**Specialization:**
Tailoring to specific use cases.

### Building Your Own AI Moat

**Strategy:**
Use fine-tuning and post-training to create differentiation.

**How:**
1. Build proprietary datasets
2. Fine-tune models for your domain
3. Continuously improve through feedback
4. Develop specialized capabilities
5. Create defensible advantages

**Advantage:**
Others can use same base model; your fine-tuning creates difference.

## The Rise of Code-Native Interfaces

### The Shift from GUI to Code

**Current paradigm:**
Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) dominant.

**Emerging paradigm:**
Code-native interfaces (agents, APIs, natural language).

**Why the shift:**
- Easier for agents to interact with code than GUIs
- More flexible and powerful
- Better for automation
- GUIs optimized for human vision

### Examples of Code-Native Tools

**Cursor:**
- Code editor optimized for AI
- Growing rapidly (~$300M ARR)
- Developers love it
- Better human-AI collaboration

**Windsurf:**
- Another code-native interface
- Over 1 million developers in months
- Optimized for AI interaction

**Bolt, Replit, Lovable:**
- All moving toward code-native
- Better for human-AI teams
- More natural for developers

### Implications

**For UX design:**
GUIs may become less central.

**For developers:**
Code-native tools more important.

**For companies:**
Interfaces need to work with both humans and agents.

## The Agentic Society

### Asha's Vision

**Future:**
Where org charts become work charts.

**Characteristic:**
Agents outnumber humans in companies.

**Not dystopian:**
Humans focused on judgment, strategy, creativity.
Agents handle execution, optimization, routine tasks.

### How It Changes Organizations

**Before:**
- 100 humans managing work
- Org chart with 100 positions
- Humans do 100% of work

**After:**
- 20 humans, 80 agents
- Work chart showing tasks and flows
- Humans do 20% of work
- Agents do 80% of work

### What Humans Focus On

**High-value activities:**
- Strategic decisions
- Creative problem-solving
- Relationship building
- Judgment and ethics
- Learning and growth

**Agents handle:**
- Routine execution
- Data processing
- Pattern matching
- Optimization
- Repetitive tasks

### Timeline

**Near-term (1-3 years):**
Hybrid human-agent teams.

**Medium-term (3-5 years):**
Agents outnumber humans in knowledge work.

**Longer-term:**
Agentic society becomes normal.

## Work Charts vs. Org Charts

### The New Organizing Principle

**Org chart:**
Shows hierarchy and reporting relationships.

**Work chart:**
Shows tasks, workflows, and where work happens.

**Key difference:**
Not about positions, about work being done.

### How It Works

**Example work chart:**
```
Customer needs support
    ↓
AI agent routes to right human (if needed)
    ↓
Human + agent team solves
    ↓
Outcome tracked
    ↓
System learns for next time
```

**No fixed positions:**
Work assigned based on capability and availability.

**Flexible:**
Easy to add humans or agents as needed.

## How Microsoft Uses Agents

### Real-World Examples

**Dragon Medical One:**
Medical professionals working with AI agents for clinical workflows.

**Copilot:**
Agents assisting developers, creators, business users.

**Internal systems:**
Using agents internally while developing for customers.

### Strategy

**Customer-zero approach:**
Microsoft uses internally what it sells externally.

**Benefit:**
Authenticity and deep understanding.

**Result:**
Products battle-tested on own teams.

## Post-Training and Optimization Loops

### Reinforcement Learning (RL)

**Concept:**
Training agents through feedback from outcomes.

**How it works:**
Agent takes action → gets reward signal → improves

**Application:**
Building agents that optimize for outcomes you care about.

### Creating Effective Loops

**Components:**
1. Clear reward signal (what's good outcome?)
2. Agent decision-making (what actions available?)
3. Outcome measurement (what actually happened?)
4. Learning (how to improve?)

**Result:**
Continuous improvement through feedback.

### Building Competitive Advantage

**Strategy:**
- Create unique feedback loops
- Develop specialized training data
- Invest in optimization
- Build defensible capabilities

## Planning and Strategy in AI Landscape

### The Planning Challenge

**Problem:**
Traditional strategic planning assumes stability.

**Reality:**
AI landscape changes rapidly.

### Approach at Microsoft

**Principles:**
- Set direction, not detailed plans
- Build flexibility in strategy
- Measure and adjust frequently
- Empower teams to adapt
- Stay aligned on outcomes

**Example:**
Rather than "build X with Y features by Z date," it's "move toward outcome O, adjust based on market."

## Platform Fundamentals

### Why Platforms Matter

**Reality:**
Most value captured by platforms, not applications.

**Reason:**
Platforms enable everyone to build.

### Platform Principles

**1. Interoperability:**
Easy for agents and humans to work together.

**2. Extensibility:**
Others can build on your platform.

**3. Reliability:**
Foundation stable for builders.

**4. Developer experience:**
Easy to build on platform.

**5. Governance:**
Clear rules about what's allowed.

### Microsoft's Platform Strategy

**Approach:**
Make Azure and AI services the platform.

**Enable:**
Companies build their AI products on Microsoft foundation.

12. **Optimism combined with discipline** — Believe in possibility while executing rigorously

## The Bottom Line

Asha Sharma's insights from working with 15,000+ organizations reveal a fundamental transformation underway. The shift from "product as artifact" to "product as organism" isn't just about technology—it's about how we conceive of building, organizing, and scaling.

The emergence of task networks replacing org charts represents a profound organizational shift. As agents become capable of handling routine execution, organizations can flatten, with humans freed to focus on judgment, strategy, and creativity. This isn't dystopian automation—it's optimal delegation where machines handle what they're good at (optimization, pattern matching, consistency) and humans handle what they're good at (judgment, creativity, relationships).

The most important pattern Asha identifies is the three-phase journey nearly all successful AI companies follow: foundation and reliability (hardest phase, most failures), customization and context, then autonomy at scale. Understanding where you are in that journey and focusing on phase-appropriate challenges determines success.

The shift toward post-training investment and fine-tuning as competitive advantage suggests the field is maturing. With foundation models available to everyone, differentiation comes from specialized training and optimization. Build proprietary feedback loops, create high-quality training data for your domain, invest in post-training—that's how you build an AI moat.

Microsoft's "seasons" planning framework and code-native interface strategy exemplify thinking ahead of the curve. Accept that detailed yearly plans are obsolete in rapidly changing AI landscape. Instead, establish direction and seasons (goals), then measure and adapt continuously. Similarly, if agents interact better with code than GUIs, the interface of the future needs to work for both humans and agents.

The vision of the "agentic society" where agents outnumber humans in organizations isn't about unemployment—it's about optimal allocation of capability. Humans do what humans do best (judgment, creativity, relationships); agents do what agents do best (execution, optimization, consistency). Organizations that embrace this division of labor will dramatically outperform those clinging to human-only models.

For product leaders, engineers, and strategists, Asha's insights offer a roadmap: embrace continuous evolution, organize around outcomes not positions, invest in post-training and fine-tuning, build for agent collaboration, and recognize that foundation is the hardest phase. Master those, and you're building the AI products of the future.
