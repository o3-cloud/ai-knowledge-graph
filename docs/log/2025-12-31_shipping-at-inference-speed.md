# Shipping at Inference Speed

Peter Steinberger documents a fundamental shift in how modern AI-powered development works. With GPT-5 and GPT-5.2, he's achieved a radically different workflow where inference time, not coding skill, becomes the bottleneck.

## Key Observations

### Model Capability Leap
GPT-5.2 represents a major jump in code understanding and refactoring. The author reports he now watches code stream rather than reading it—it's fast enough and good enough to trust.

### Workflow Transformation
- **Parallelism**: Works on 3-8 simultaneous projects instead of deep focus on one
- **Version control**: Commits directly to main instead of using feature branches
- **Communication**: Uses visual examples and short prompts instead of long specifications
- **Task management**: Relies on queuing rather than complex project management

### The New Bottleneck
"The amount of software I can create is mostly limited by inference time and hard thinking." Coding velocity is no longer constrained by typing speed or even reasoning—it's waiting for tokens.

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Technology choice matters**: Language/ecosystem selection impacts agent compatibility (Go, TypeScript, Swift perform well)
2. **Architecture over implementation**: Strategic decisions about dependencies and structure matter more than implementation details
3. **Iterative collaboration**: Agents work best with repeated refinement rather than perfect upfront specs
4. **CLI-first development**: Building command-line tools before UI accelerates overall throughput

## Implications for Development

- **Skill shift**: The value is now in architectural thinking, not syntax knowledge
- **Scaling capacity**: One developer can maintain multiple parallel projects
- **Risk profile changes**: Direct-to-main commits possible when agent quality is high
- **Tool selection**: Ecosystem maturity for agent interaction affects productivity
