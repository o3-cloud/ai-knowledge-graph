# Beads: AI Agent Memory and Task Management System

**Video:** Beyond Instructions: How Beads Lets AI Agents Build Like Engineers
**Creator:** Steve Yegge (via AI Tinkerers One-Shot)
**Duration:** ~48 minutes
**Published:** December 12, 2025

## Key Concepts

The Beads framework reimagines how AI coding agents approach complex, multi-step engineering tasks. Rather than treating each interaction as isolated instructions, Beads gives agents:

- **Session Memory**: Agents can maintain context across multiple interactions and remember previous work within a session
- **Autonomous Task Management**: Structured workflows for managing multi-step projects
- **Guided Autonomy**: Engineers supervise and guide AI agents rather than just writing code themselves

## Core Features Discussed

### 1. Multimodal Prompting
- Agents use screenshots for visual validation of their work
- Combines code context with visual feedback to improve accuracy
- Enables agents to verify UI changes and interactions

### 2. Code Review Integration
- Automated code review techniques to assess agent confidence
- Methods to validate output quality before deployment
- Bottleneck identification in traditional review workflows

### 3. Session Cleanup ("Landing the Plane")
- Automated mechanisms to properly close out work sessions
- Ensures agents complete partial work and clean up state
- Prevents lingering incomplete changes

### 4. Evolution from Chaos to Structure
- Early approach: Markdown files with scattered context (chaos)
- Current approach: Issue-based, structured workflows
- Move toward proper project management for AI agents

## Organizational Deployment

Steve shares insights on deploying AI tools at scale:
- Integration challenges within existing team workflows
- Graphite solution for managing code review bottlenecks
- Balancing junior and senior developer workflows with AI assistance

## Implementation Insights

The Beads framework has:
- Gathered hundreds of contributors within weeks of launch
- Demonstrated viability for both simple and complex coding tasks
- Shown how React game development can showcase agent capabilities

## Relevance to Our Project

This video is particularly relevant for:
- Understanding how to structure agent memory systems
- Learning multimodal prompting techniques for better validation
- Implementing proper session management for coding agents
- Designing agent workflows that scale within organizations
