# 2026: The Year The IDE Died

**Speakers:** Steve Yegge (Engineering Leader, Sourcegraph/Amp) & Gene Kim (Author & Researcher, IT Revolution)
**Uploader:** AI Engineer
**Upload Date:** December 6, 2025

## Overview

Steve Yegge and Gene Kim explore the significant lag between AI capability advances and developer adoption, investigating why software engineers globally remain 9-12 months behind the technology curve. They share predictions for 2026's AI coding tools and paint a vision of the future of development.

## Key Themes

### Developer-AI Technology Gap

Despite AI capabilities advancing rapidly, developers have consistently resisted adopting the most powerful tools available. This creates a significant lag where developers operate with outdated workflows while more capable solutions exist.

### IDE Transformation in 2026

The speakers predict that traditional IDEs will undergo radical transformation, moving from static development environments to AI-augmented, agent-capable systems. The "IDE as we know it" will fundamentally change as AI agents become first-class development partners.

### Vibe Coding and Evolution

Discussion connects to vibe coding concepts—where developers work strategically with AI agents rather than struggling against them. This represents an evolution in how engineering work gets done.
