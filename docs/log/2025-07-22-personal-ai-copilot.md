# Build Your Personal AI Copilot

**Author:** Tal Raviv
**Publication:** Lenny's Newsletter
**Publication Date:** July 22, 2025

## Overview

A framework for treating AI language models as ongoing thinking partners rather than one-off tools. The key insight: providing sufficient context transforms generic AI assistance into genuinely personalized strategic partnership. LLMs can function like knowledgeable colleagues who understand your company, role, and objectives.

## The Core Concept

### From Tool to Partner

**One-off tool mindset:**
- Ask question, get answer
- No persistent context
- Generic responses
- Start fresh each time

**Thinking partner mindset:**
- Ongoing relationship
- Accumulated context
- Personalized responses
- Builds over time

### The Transformation

Context transforms AI from:
- Generic assistant → Strategic partner
- Question answerer → Thinking companion
- Task executor → Knowledgeable colleague

## The Four-Step Framework

### Step 1: Hiring Your Copilot (Instructions)

**Purpose:** Set behavioral expectations and values

**Implementation:** System prompts that establish:
- Your role and context
- Expected behavior
- Communication style
- Values and priorities

**Example template:**
> "I am a [role] at [company], and you are my expert coach and advisor."

### Step 2: Onboarding Your Copilot (Project Knowledge)

**Purpose:** Establish shared context

**Documents to upload:**
| Document Type | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| Strategy decks | Company direction |
| Customer research | User understanding |
| Competitive analysis | Market context |
| Org charts | Stakeholder map |
| Performance reviews | Personal context |

**Result:** Shared foundation for all future conversations

### Step 3: Kicking Off Initiatives (Chat Threads)

**Purpose:** Create dedicated spaces for each project

**Technique:**
- One thread per project/initiative
- Use speech-to-text for informal context
- Share background on problems and stakeholders
- Build project-specific understanding

**Why speech-to-text:**
- Lower friction than typing
- More natural context sharing
- Captures nuance and tone
- Faster knowledge transfer

### Step 4: Putting It to Work (Conversational Prompts)

**Purpose:** Get sophisticated, personalized responses

**With proper context, simple queries work:**
> "What's the single most important thing I should do next?"

**Why this works:**
- Context already established
- AI understands full situation
- Responses are tailored
- No need for elaborate prompts

## Tools & Platforms

### Projects Features

Available in:
- ChatGPT (Projects)
- Claude (Projects)
- M365 Copilot
- Gemini

### Workaround Without Projects

Maintain a single text file with:
- Instructions
- Key knowledge
- Paste into conversations as needed

## Practical Applications

### Strategic Work

| Task | How Copilot Helps |
|------|-------------------|
| Roadmap brainstorming | Context-aware suggestions |
| Complex decisions | Structured analysis |
| Data analysis | Interpretation with context |

### Tactical Tasks

| Task | How Copilot Helps |
|------|-------------------|
| User stories/PRDs | Draft with company context |
| Presentation decks | On-brand, informed content |
| Slack updates | Appropriate tone and detail |

### Innovative Work

| Task | How Copilot Helps |
|------|-------------------|
| AI prototyping | Vibe coding with context |
| Automation ideas | Event-driven suggestions |
| Difficult conversations | Preparation and framing |

## Key Workflows

### Gossip Updates

**Technique:** Regularly share developments via speech-to-text

**Characteristics:**
- No formal structure needed
- Casual, conversational
- LLM retains and references
- Builds ongoing context

**Why it works:** Models are good at connecting dots from informal information.

### Prototyping Prompts

**After discussing a solution:**
1. Request interactive prototypes in chat
2. Or generate prompts for external tools (v0, Bolt)
3. Context carries through to prototype specs

### Automation Ideation

**Ask copilot to identify:**
- Repetitive work patterns
- Tasks requiring judgment but not expertise
- Event-driven automation opportunities
- Workflow improvements

## Critical Mindset Shifts

### Human Judgment Remains Central

**The copilot inspires thinking—doesn't replace it.**

Your role:
- Evaluate suggestions
- Apply judgment
- Make final decisions
- Provide direction

### When Outputs Disappoint

**Don't abandon the tool.**

Instead:
- Provide better context
- Give clearer guidance
- Refine instructions
- Add relevant knowledge

### "Models are really good at connecting the dots"
— Karina Nguyen

The insight: AI excels at synthesis when given sufficient dots to connect.

## Knowledge Compounding

### After Initiatives Complete

**Update project knowledge with:**
- Retrospectives
- Personal reflections
- Lessons learned
- Outcome data

**Result:**
- Transparent institutional memory
- Curated knowledge base
- Improved future advice
- Compounding value over time

## Emerging Opportunities

### Current Gaps

| Gap | Future Possibility |
|-----|-------------------|
| Manual updates | Automatic knowledge from connected systems |
| Individual only | Shared team-level copilot foundations |
| Reactive | Proactive suggestions from calendar/workflow |

### The Vision

AI copilot that:
- Stays current automatically
- Onboards new team members
- Anticipates needs proactively
- Integrates across tools

## Key Takeaways

1. **Partner, not tool** — Ongoing relationship, not one-off queries
2. **Four steps** — Hire, onboard, kick off, put to work
3. **Context is key** — Transforms generic to personalized
4. **Upload foundations** — Strategy, research, org context
5. **Dedicated threads** — One per project/initiative
6. **Gossip updates** — Informal context via speech-to-text
7. **Human judgment central** — AI inspires, you decide
8. **Knowledge compounds** — Update after initiatives complete

## The Bottom Line

Building a personal AI copilot means treating LLMs as ongoing thinking partners rather than one-off tools. The four-step framework—hiring (instructions), onboarding (project knowledge), kicking off (chat threads), and putting to work (simple prompts)—creates the context necessary for genuinely personalized assistance. The key insight: context transforms generic AI into strategic partnership. With proper foundation, simple questions like "What should I do next?" yield sophisticated, contextual responses. Human judgment remains central—the copilot inspires thinking rather than replacing it. As knowledge compounds over time through updates and reflections, the partnership becomes increasingly valuable.
