# Agentic Design Patterns: A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems

## Overview

Antonio Gulli's comprehensive 424-page guide explores foundational patterns for building intelligent AI agents. The work covers core concepts like RAG, Reflection, Routing, Memory, and many others that serve as building blocks for modern AI systems.

## Part One: Fundamental Techniques (7 chapters)

- **Prompt Chaining** — Sequential task decomposition through prompts
- **Routing** — Directing requests to appropriate handlers or models
- **Parallelization** — Running multiple operations concurrently
- **Reflection** — Self-evaluation and improvement loops
- **Tool Use** — Integrating external tools and APIs
- **Planning** — Strategic decomposition of complex goals
- **Multi-Agent Systems** — Coordinating multiple agents

## Part Two: Memory and Learning

- Memory management strategies for agents
- Learning mechanisms for improving over time
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration
- Goal monitoring and tracking

## Part Three: Robustness and Integration

- Exception handling and error recovery
- Human-in-the-loop systems
- Knowledge retrieval and integration

## Part Four: Advanced Topics

- Agent communication patterns
- Resource optimization
- Advanced reasoning techniques
- Safety guardrails
- Evaluation methods

## Additional Resources

- Practical code examples throughout each chapter
- Appendices covering advanced prompting, frameworks, CLI applications, and reasoning engines
