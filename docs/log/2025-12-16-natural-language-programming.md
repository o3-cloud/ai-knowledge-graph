# On the Success of 'Natural Language Programming'

## Key Arguments

Marc Brooker challenges the criticism that natural language lacks precision for programming, making several important points:

### Natural Language has Always Been Central
Programs originate from natural language requirements gathered through conversations with stakeholders. The disconnect between stakeholder needs and code happens through miscommunication—not because natural language itself is imprecise.

### Vibe Coding Through Iteration
Rather than one-shot solutions, the future involves iterative loops between developers and AI—what Brooker calls "vibe coding." This mirrors how professional software has always been built: through dialogue, sketches, and gradual clarification.

### Neurosymbolic Approaches for Critical Systems
For systems requiring exactness, Brooker proposes combining natural language with formal reasoning tools. Human reviewers can validate the generated formal models, embedding the specifier in a quality-assurance conversation.

## The Core Insight

The future of programming returns to the past: specification through natural language interaction, occasional mathematical rigor when needed, and accumulated shared context that streamlines future communications.

This represents a fundamental shift from "write code" to "refine specifications" as the primary development activity.
