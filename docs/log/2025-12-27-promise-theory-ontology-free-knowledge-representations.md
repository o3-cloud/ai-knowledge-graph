# Promise Theory for Ontology-Free Knowledge Representations

## Overview

This theoretical research paper by Mark Burgess develops a novel semantic framework for modeling attention and knowledge representation in cognitive agents. The core contribution is applying promise theory to enable "ontology-free" knowledge representations—allowing agents to construct and revise knowledge dynamically rather than relying on pre-defined taxonomies.

## Research Problem

Traditional knowledge representation systems require comprehensive advance specification of all possible knowledge categories through fixed ontologies. This approach is:
- Brittle to new domains or concepts
- Difficult to extend dynamically
- Requires humans to define structure upfront

## Proposed Solution: Promise-Theoretic Semantics

### Core Concept

Promise theory provides a mathematical foundation for formalizing how cognitive agents handle attention and knowledge through:
- **Dynamic commitments** rather than fixed categories
- **Promise-based relationships** that can be revised
- **Flexible semantic structures** that adapt without redesign

### Key Framework Element: γ(3,4)

The notation $\gamma(3,4)$ represents a specific semantic structure within the promise-theoretic framework. This structure offers theoretical advantages for modeling complex reasoning without requiring comprehensive advance specification.

## Key Implications

1. **Flexibility**: Agents can dynamically construct and revise knowledge without architectural changes
2. **Scalability**: No need to enumerate all possible categories upfront
3. **Reasoning Quality**: Promise theory provides mathematically rigorous foundations for attention and inference
4. **Adaptability**: Same framework can handle diverse domains by adjusting semantic structures

## Relationship to Cognitive Systems

The framework is particularly relevant for:
- Cognitive agent architectures
- Dynamic attention mechanisms in reasoning systems
- Knowledge integration and fusion
- Semantic grounding without fixed ontologies

## Theoretical Foundation

Promise theory, originally developed for distributed systems modeling, is applied here to cognitive representation. The insight is that knowledge relationships can be modeled similarly to distributed system commitments:
- Agents make promises about what they know
- Relationships emerge from promise fulfillment and satisfaction
- The system adapts as promises are revised or fulfilled

## Comparison to Traditional Approaches

| Aspect | Traditional Ontologies | Promise-Theoretic Approach |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Structure | Fixed, predefined | Dynamic, promise-based |
| Extension | Requires redesign | Emerges from commitments |
| Representation | Hierarchical taxonomy | Relational commitments |
| Flexibility | Low (locked in structure) | High (adaptive) |
| Mathematical rigor | Logic-based | Promise theory-based |

## Relevance to AI/LLM Systems

This research is relevant for:
1. **Knowledge representation in LLMs** - Alternative to fixed knowledge graphs
2. **Semantic grounding** - Promise theory as mathematical foundation for meaning
3. **Agent architectures** - Dynamic knowledge for reasoning without enumeration
4. **Attention mechanisms** - Formal theory for what agents focus on
5. **Ontology-free systems** - Reducing brittleness in knowledge-based AI

This is a theoretical research paper published on arXiv (preprint). Key considerations:
- Focuses on mathematical foundations rather than empirical validation
- Practical implementation examples may be limited
- Would benefit from empirical evaluation or case studies
