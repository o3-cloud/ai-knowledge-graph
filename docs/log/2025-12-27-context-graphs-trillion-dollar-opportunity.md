# Context Graphs: AI's Trillion-Dollar Opportunity

## Overview

Foundation Capital identifies context graphs as potentially the next trillion-dollar opportunity in enterprise AI. The core insight is that AI agents are being deployed into real workflows but consistently hit a critical limitation: the absence of preserved decision context and traces.

## Core Definition

**Context Graph:** "A living record of decision traces stitched across entities and time so precedent becomes searchable."

Key characteristics:
- Captures decisions, not just transactions or objects
- Preserves the context and reasoning behind decisions
- Enables precedent to be discoverable and auditable
- Connects decisions across entities and time

## The Problem: The Missing Context Layer

### Current State

AI agents are shipping into production workflows across multiple domains:
- Contract review and analysis
- Quote-to-cash processes
- Support ticket resolution
- Compliance and policy enforcement

### The Wall They Hit

Despite this deployment, teams consistently encounter the same fundamental limitation: **decision traces are not preserved**.

### Concrete Example

When a sales discount is approved:
- The discount decision is recorded
- The transaction is logged
- But the context that justified the decision is lost

**Consequences:**
- Cannot audit why the decision was made
- Cannot learn from past decisions to improve future ones
- Cannot use precedent to handle similar situations
- Each decision must be made independently without historical context

## The Business Opportunity

### Two Possible Futures

**Question:** Are new systems of record being created, or is the opportunity to add AI to existing systems?

**Option A - New Systems of Record:**
- Context graphs become the foundation of a new class of enterprise system
- Focused on recording decisions, not just objects or transactions
- Becomes the "system of record for enterprise decisions"
- Could represent a trillion-dollar platform opportunity

**Option B - AI Layer on Existing Systems:**
- AI is bolted onto existing data and record systems
- Smaller opportunity, lower barrier to entry
- Incremental improvement rather than fundamental shift

### Why This Matters

The context graph is not merely a feature or enhancement. It's positioned as a foundational infrastructure layer that enables:
1. **Effective AI agents** - Agents need context to make better decisions
2. **Decision accountability** - Audit trails for compliance and governance
3. **Organizational learning** - Precedent-driven decision making
4. **Scalable intelligence** - Encoding organizational wisdom in decision traces

## Market Dynamics

The thesis is gaining traction in the AI and enterprise software communities, with significant discussion about:
- Whether context graphs are essential infrastructure for agentic workflows
- How organizations will build decision records alongside transaction records
- The competitive advantage of enterprises that master decision tracing
- Platform opportunities for tools that build context graphs

## Key Insight

Current systems of record (databases, CRMs, ERPs) track what happened (objects, transactions, states). Context graphs would track how and why decisions are made. This distinction could define the next generation of enterprise software platforms.

## Implications for AI Agent Architecture

For AI agents to operate effectively in enterprises:
1. They need access to decision context, not just transaction data
2. They need to preserve the reasoning for their own decisions
3. They need to learn from historical decision patterns
4. Systems must evolve to support decision-centric records

Without this layer, agents remain disconnected from organizational memory and context.

## Data Quality Notes

This is a market opportunity analysis and strategic thesis rather than empirical research or technical specification. Key considerations:
- Based on observing real deployment patterns of AI agents
- Builds on domain knowledge of enterprise software evolution
- The trillion-dollar figure is a market size estimate, not a validated number
- Implementation details of context graphs vary across different approaches
