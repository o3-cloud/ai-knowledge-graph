## The Bottom Line

Shao, Zope, Jiang, Pei, Nguyen, Brynjolfsson, and Yang's research provides the most granular, empirically grounded assessment to date of how AI agents could reshape the American workforce. The critical contribution is moving beyond binary "replacement vs. not replacement" thinking to distinguish automation potential (task replacement) from augmentation potential (productivity enhancement).

The findings reveal a complex picture: automation will displace some roles, but augmentation opportunities are substantial across many occupations. Impact varies dramatically by occupation, sector, and task type. Lower-skill, routine-focused roles face greatest displacement risk. Higher-skill, judgment-heavy roles offer significant augmentation opportunity.

The economic and policy implications are substantial. Displacement concentrated among lower-wage workers could worsen inequality unless actively managed. Augmentation opportunities require training in human-AI collaboration skills. Education systems need reorientation toward human capabilities that complement AI (judgment, creativity, strategic thinking).

For businesses, the strategic choice is clear: companies investing in augmentation while managing displacement will outperform those pursuing pure automation. This requires workforce development investment, workflow redesign, and commitment to human-centric AI strategies.

The research doesn't predict doom or utopia—instead, it demonstrates that outcomes depend on choices. With proactive policy, business strategy, and education investment aligned around augmentation opportunities, the AI future could meaningfully enhance human productivity and capability. Without such alignment, displacement risks are real and concentrated on vulnerable populations.

The framework provides policymakers and business leaders the empirical foundation needed to make informed, occupationally-specific decisions about workforce transformation. This granular approach—moving from abstract predictions to specific occupational analysis—represents a maturation in how we think about AI's labor market impact.
