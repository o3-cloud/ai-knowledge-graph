# Bad Programmers Are About to Become Very Exposed

**Author:** Sam Schillace
**Publication:** Sunday Letters (Substack)
**Publication Date:** December 8, 2025

## Overview

Sam Schillace argues that AI coding tools are creating a fundamental divide in technical work. The distinction isn't between good and bad programmers in the traditional sense—it's between "coders" who excel at following instructions and "engineers" who excel at problem decomposition and strategic thinking. The former face obsolescence; the latter gain extraordinary leverage.

## The Coder vs. Engineer Distinction

### Coders
- Skilled at following instructions
- Excel at implementing specifications
- Focus on execution of defined tasks
- Value derived from technical implementation accuracy

### Engineers
- Excel at breaking down complex problems
- Invent novel solutions
- Design robust, scalable systems
- Think in first principles
- Set strategic direction

## Historical Context

Early in software development, developers had no choice but to think as engineers:
- Documentation was sparse
- Fields remained unstructured
- Resourcefulness was mandatory
- First-principles thinking required by necessity

This scarcity forced developers to develop higher-order problem-solving skills rather than instruction-following patterns.

## The Current Inflection Point

Agentic coding tools now replicate what traditional coders do well:
- Following technical instructions
- Implementing specifications
- Executing defined patterns
- Translating requirements to code

**Key insight:** AI agents perform these instruction-following tasks as competently—or better—than humans.

**Consequence:** The market value of "instruction-following" expertise is rapidly diminishing.

## The Emerging Productivity Divide

### Engineers with AI Tools
- Gain extraordinary leverage
- Potential **50x productivity multipliers**
- AI amplifies strategic thinking
- Problem decomposition becomes the bottleneck
- High-level direction drives massive output

### Coders Without Strategic Skills
- Face obsolescence
- Primary value proposition automated
- Execution skills commoditized
- Differentiation becomes impossible
- Career trajectory threatened

## What Remains Valuable

**Successful AI tool use requires:**
1. Thoughtful problem decomposition
2. Higher-order strategic thinking
3. Clear intention-setting
4. System design capability
5. Judgment about approach selection

**The persistent human requirement:**
The capacity to articulate well-conceived objectives and approaches remains irreplaceably human.

## Broader Implications for Knowledge Work

Schillace predicts this dynamic extends beyond programming:

**Roles at risk:**
- Any role fundamentally built on executing instructions
- Work defined by following established patterns
- Tasks reducible to specification implementation

**Roles that persist:**
- Workers demonstrating sophisticated reasoning
- Clear intention-setting capabilities
- Strategic problem decomposition
- Novel solution invention

## The Leverage Equation

The gap between AI-augmented engineers and traditional coders creates unprecedented productivity disparity:

| Skill Profile | AI Impact | Productivity |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Strategic + AI tools | Amplified | 50x baseline |
| Execution-focused | Replaced | Declining |
| Instruction-following | Automated | Near zero unique value |

## Key Takeaways

### For Individual Developers

1. **Assess honestly:** Are you primarily following instructions or decomposing problems?
2. **Invest in strategy:** Problem decomposition and system design matter most
3. **Use AI strategically:** Tools amplify existing thinking capability
4. **Develop judgment:** Knowing what to build matters more than building it

### For Organizations

1. **Hiring shifts:** Prioritize strategic thinkers over execution specialists
2. **Team composition changes:** Fewer implementers, more architects
3. **Skill development:** Train for decomposition and design, not just coding
4. **Leverage recognition:** Identify and empower high-leverage individuals

### For the Industry

1. **Credential devaluation:** Implementation skills lose market value
2. **New bottlenecks:** Strategic thinking becomes the constraint
3. **Productivity concentration:** Fewer people produce more output
4. **Career restructuring:** Traditional progression paths disrupted

## The Exposure Effect

The title's "exposure" works on multiple levels:
- **Skill gaps exposed:** AI makes clear who adds strategic value
- **Value proposition exposed:** Instruction-following revealed as automatable
- **Career risk exposed:** Vulnerable positions become obvious
- **Opportunity exposed:** Engineers see leverage potential

## Implications for AI-Assisted Development

This perspective aligns with broader observations about production AI agents:
- Human judgment remains essential at strategic level
- Execution increasingly automated
- Value concentrates in problem definition
- Architects become more valuable than implementers

## The Bottom Line

AI tools don't replace thinking—they replace execution. Developers whose primary contribution is turning specifications into code face direct competition from AI. Developers whose primary contribution is determining what should be built, how systems should work, and which approaches solve problems gain unprecedented amplification.

The question isn't whether you can code. The question is whether you can engineer.
