# Symposium-Driven Development: A Not So New Paradigm for Software Creation

**Author:** Owen Zanzal
**Platform:** Medium (DevOps+AI)
**Publication Date:** July 11, 2025
**Type:** Development Paradigm and Philosophy
**Duration:** 6 min read
**Key Concept:** Structured dialogue and exploration as foundation for software development in the AI era

## Overview

Owen Zanzal introduces Symposium-Driven Development (SDD)—a fundamental paradigm shift in how software teams approach creation. As AI automation handles the labor of implementation (boilerplate, glue code, testing, shipping), teams suddenly have freed-up time and capacity. Rather than simply sprinting faster, SDD proposes using that freedom to engage in what ancient Greeks called scholê—intentional, structured exploration of hard, ambiguous, strategic questions before coding begins. The result is software that's worth building, shaped by collective wisdom, and grounded in clear understanding of what and why before rushing to implement how.

## The Spark: Claude Code and Freed Time

### What Triggered the Realization

**Experience with Claude Code:**
- AI solves what used to be hard (boilerplate, glue code, tedious work)
- Labor of software development no longer feels like struggle
- More like blank canvas than grinding execution
- Suddenly there's time available

### The Question That Emerges

When labor gets automated away, what becomes possible?

**From:**
"How do we translate business ideas into working code?"

**To:**
"What do we do with all the time we're about to get back?"

## The Historical Parallel: Back to the Symposium

### Ancient Greek Precedent

**The symposium (ancient Greece):**
When people were freed from daily survival grind, they didn't relax.
They gathered.

### What Was a Symposium?

**Structure:**
Structured gathering of thinkers, artists, weirdos

**Purpose:**
Wrestling with big questions together:
- What is justice?
- What is beauty?
- What makes a good life?

**Method:**
Thinking together, out loud, about things that matter

### Why This Matters Today

**Modern software teams:**
Rarely make time for this kind of thinking

**What gets squeezed out:**
Strategic inquiry, big-picture questions, deep exploration

**What gets optimized for:**
Delivery, velocity, execution, sprint boards

**The insight:**
Ancient Greeks understood that freed time should be invested in thinking together, not just individual relaxation.

## Symposium-Driven Development (SDD)

### Definition

**Symposium-Driven Development:**
A shift from endless execution to intentional exploration, made possible by AI automation and inspired by ancient Socratic dialogue. Software teams use freed-up time to engage in structured, facilitated, recorded conversations that sharpen problem definition and strategic thinking before implementation begins.

### Core Principle

```
Labor (coding) → Handled by AI
↓
Freedom (time) → Available to team
↓
Leisure (scholê) → Space for wisdom and thinking
↓
Better software → Built from collective understanding
```

### Not Design by Committee

**Critical distinction:**

SDD is NOT:
- Design by committee (compromise)
- Endless input (dilution)
- Consensus-seeking (lowest common denominator)
- Everyone has equal say in final direction

**SDD IS:**
- Guided exploration (sharpening vision)
- Structured input (revealing insights)
- Clarity-seeking (deep understanding)
- Diverse perspectives → singular clarity

### Why the Distinction Matters

**Design by committee problems:**
- Many voices
- No clear ownership
- Final product feels compromised
- Blurred vision from diluted input

**SDD approach:**
- Many voices
- Clear facilitation
- Final product sharper from diverse input
- Sharpened vision from explored trade-offs

## The Goal: Clarity, Not Consensus

### What SDD Aims to Reveal

**Not:**
- Get everyone to agree
- Find middle ground
- Make everyone happy
- Consensus decision-making

**But:**
- Surface blind spots
- Expose hidden assumptions
- Reveal ripple effects
- Identify true trade-offs
- Sharpen understanding of problem

### How AI Enables This

**Without AI:**
Insights get lost in conversation ether
Notes scattered across notebooks
Key nuances forgotten
Implementation makes assumptions

**With AI:**
- Everything captured and transcribed
- Insights synthesized automatically
- Nuances preserved and integrated
- Implementation grounded in captured wisdom
- No design limbo, no scope creep

**Result:**
Same dialogue benefits, but with persistent capture and synthesis.

## A Modern Software Symposium: Real Example

### The Setup

**Setting:**
Virtual room (or in-person)

**No:**
- Sprint updates
- Status reports about blockers
- Ticket discussions
- Velocity metrics

**Yes:**
- One question written at top of shared doc
- Deep exploration of that question
- Diverse perspectives gathered
- Structured conversation

### The Question

```
"Should we even build this thing?"
```

Simple but profound.

### The Participants

**Around the digital table:**

**1. Backend Engineer**
- Sees patterns
- Knows where similar approaches break
- Brings systems perspective
- Understands infrastructure implications

**2. Designer**
- Obsessed with user friction
- Brings user experience lens
- Questions usability assumptions
- Highlights design complexity

**3. Data Analyst**
- Holding two surprising charts
- Brings data-driven insights
- Questions assumptions with evidence
- Reveals unexpected patterns

**4. Customer Support Lead**
- Direct user feedback
- Holds frustrated customer quotes
- Brings voice of reality
- Reveals actual pain points

**5. AI Assistant**
- Already read last 6 PRDs
- Reviewed 2 RFCs
- Researched relevant blog posts (including that 2018 one everyone forgot)
- Brings external wisdom
- Synthesizes conversation in real-time

**6. You**
- Facilitator
- Final decision-maker
- Integrator of perspectives
- Responsible for clarity

### The Conversation (2 Hours)

**Goal:** Really talk (not defend)

**What happens:**
- Explore the problem
- Surface trade-offs
- Ask better questions
- Listen deeply

**What's different:**
Not defending a roadmap, but discovering understanding

### The Capture

**During conversation:**
- Everything recorded
- Transcribed in real-time
- AI sketches early drafts of requirements from emerging themes
- Key insights highlighted

**After conversation:**
- Everyone leaves smarter (including AI)
- Requirements already drafted from captured wisdom
- No translation needed from notes to implementation
- Vision is clear and recorded

## From Labor to Leisure: The Ancient Concept

### Scholê: Freedom from Toil

**Greek concept:**
scholê (σχολή) — freedom from daily grind, space for contemplation

**Characteristics:**
- Not laziness
- Active engagement with ideas
- Dialogue and inquiry
- Space for thinking and reflection

**Historic outcome:**
Birthplace of philosophy, science, civilization

### The Paradox

Leisure → Civilization

Toil → Survival

### Modern Parallel

**For decades:**
Software development = labor
- Translate ideas to code
- Grind of implementation
- Optimization for delivery and execution

**Now:**
Software development = shifting from labor to wisdom
- AI handles translation and implementation
- Time available for thinking
- Optimization for understanding and strategy

**The question:**
Do we sprint faster with freed time, or think deeper?

### Why Wisdom Becomes the Main Event

**As labor gets automated:**
- Coding ≠ bottleneck anymore
- Understanding what to build = new bottleneck
- Asking right questions = high-value activity
- Thinking together = competitive advantage

**Result:**
Wisdom becomes the main event, not the sidebar.

## The Shape of SDD: Basic Rhythm

### Not Sprints (Agile), Not Phases (Waterfall)

**SDD is built around conversations.**

Structured, intentional, recorded conversations about big, thorny, ambiguous questions.

### The Five-Step Rhythm

#### Step 1: Ask a Better Question

**Don't start with:**
"What should we build?"

**Start with:**
- "Why should we build this?"
- "Should we build this at all?"
- "What if we didn't build this?"
- "What problem are we actually solving?"
- "Who is this really for?"

**Goal:**
Reframe from execution to understanding

#### Step 2: Gather the Right Minds

**Not:**
Whoever's available in the sprint

**But:**
- Radically different perspectives
- Engineers with system knowledge
- Designers with user empathy
- Users or user representatives
- People who will dissent or challenge
- Even an AI or two

**Principle:**
Diversity sharpens understanding, not blurs it

#### Step 3: Host the Symposium

**Duration:**
A few focused hours (not endless meetings)

**Format:**
- Structured conversation
- Facilitated like salon, not status meeting
- Everything captured and transcribed
- Real dialogue, not presentation

**Goal:**
Deep exploration of question and surrounding space

#### Step 4: Let AI Synthesize Insights

**Transcripts become:**
- Structure (organized by theme)
- Requirements (emerging from patterns)
- Discussion prompts (open questions highlighted)
- Decision points (trade-offs surfaced)

**Nothing gets lost:**
All nuance preserved and organized

#### Step 5: Decide What Matters, Then Build

**Only after thinking is solid:**
Coding begins

**By this point:**
- What you're building is clear
- Why it matters is understood
- Who it's for is defined
- Trade-offs are understood
- Hard part (what and why) is already solved

**Result:**
Implementation is clean because problem is clear

## Why This Matters Right Now

### Software Is Changing

**The work itself is shifting:**

**Before:**
Spend all energy translating messy ideas into clean code
Hard part: Making code work

**Now:**
AI translates ideas into code automatically
Hard part: Having the right ideas to translate

**The shift:**
From execution-focused to thinking-focused

### The Central Question

**As AI automation handles labor:**
What do we do with freed-up time?

**SDD's answer:**
Use it to think together, ask better questions, make better decisions

## Comparison with Traditional Approaches

### vs. Agile Sprints

| Aspect | Agile | SDD |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **Rhythm** | Sprints (time-boxed execution) | Conversations (problem exploration) |
| **Focus** | Delivery velocity | Understanding clarity |
| **When** | Before and during building | Before building |
| **Optimization** | Speed | Wisdom |
| **AI role** | Optional enhancement | Core to synthesis |

### vs. Design by Committee

| Aspect | Committee | SDD |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| **Goal** | Consensus | Clarity |
| **Input** | Everyone votes | Everyone explores |
| **Output** | Compromise | Sharpened vision |
| **Decision** | Majority rule | Facilitated understanding |

### vs. Waterfall Planning

| Aspect | Waterfall | SDD |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| **Approach** | Detailed planning upfront | Exploratory dialogue upfront |
| **Flexibility** | Change = rework | Change = new symposium |
| **Execution** | Follow plan | Implement clarity |

## Practical Implementation

### Minimal Viable Symposium

**To try this:**

1. **Pick a real question**
   - Not "what's our deadline?"
   - But "should we even build this?"

2. **Invite 4-6 people**
   - Different perspectives required
   - Include at least one person who disagrees

3. **Block 2 focused hours**
   - No parallel work
   - No checking Slack
   - Real conversation

4. **Capture everything**
   - Record audio
   - Transcribe (AI or human)
   - Screenshot shared doc

5. **Let AI synthesize**
   - Feed transcript to Claude
   - Ask for: themes, requirements, open questions, trade-offs

6. **Make one decision**
   - Based on clarity gained
   - Document decision and reasoning

### Where to Start

**Easy candidates for first symposium:**

1. **Should we adopt this new tool?**
   - Real question with trade-offs
   - Diverse perspectives matter
   - Real impact if done well

2. **How should we approach this migration?**
   - Multiple valid paths
   - Good candidates for trade-off exploration
   - Helps team alignment

3. **What problem are we really solving?**
   - Often unclear despite roadmaps
   - Symposium can clarify
   - Sets foundation for good implementation

## The Golden Age: Artificial AND Intellectual

### The Claim

**In the future:**
Best software teams won't just ship faster

**They will:**
- Understand deeper
- Listen better
- Ask what no one else thought to ask

### Why This Matters

As AI handles:
- Boilerplate
- Glue code
- Testing
- Shipping
- Bug fixing

What becomes rare and valuable?
- Deep thinking
- Novel insights
- Wise questions
- Collective exploration

### The Opportunity

**If we do it right:**

"The next golden age of software won't just be artificial. It'll be intellectual."

Meaning:
- Powered by AI labor
- Guided by human wisdom
- Result of collective thinking
- Built from deep understanding

## Key Principles of SDD

### 1. Freed Labor → Freed Time
When AI handles execution, space opens for thinking

### 2. Thinking Together > Thinking Alone
Diverse perspectives sharpen understanding

### 3. Clarity > Consensus
Goal is understanding problem, not voting on solution

### 4. Structure > Chaos
Symposium format enables real dialogue, not free-form chat

### 5. Record Everything
Nothing gets lost; all nuance captured and synthesized

### 6. Synthesize Systematically
AI turns conversation into structured requirements

### 7. Decide Before Building
Implementation only after clarity achieved

### 8. Why Before What
Problem understanding before solution design

### 9. Wisdom > Speed
Depth of thinking matters more than speed of execution

### 10. Socratic Method
Questions sharpen understanding more than answers

## The Bottom Line

Owen Zanzal introduces Symposium-Driven Development as a fundamental paradigm shift in how software teams should work in the age of AI automation. The core insight is provocative and simple: as AI handles the labor of software creation (coding, testing, shipping, fixing), teams suddenly have freed-up time. Rather than simply sprinting faster, that freedom should be invested in what ancient Greeks called scholê—intentional, structured exploration of hard, ambiguous, strategic questions.

**The mechanism:**
Gather diverse perspectives (engineers, designers, users, weirdos, AI) for structured 2-hour conversations exploring fundamental questions like "Should we even build this?" Everything gets recorded, transcribed, and synthesized by AI into clear requirements and decision frameworks.

**The outcome:**
Software that's worth building, shaped by collective wisdom, grounded in clear understanding of what and why before any implementation begins.

**The distinction:**
SDD is NOT design by committee (which blurs vision through consensus). It's guided exploration (which sharpens vision through diverse perspectives and deliberate synthesis).

**The principle:**
When labor gets automated, wisdom becomes the main event. The bottleneck shifts from "how do we code this?" to "what should we build and why?" and "is this the right thing to build?"

**For teams:**
Rather than optimizing for velocity and delivery, optimize for understanding and strategy. Use freed time to think together, ask better questions, make better decisions.

**For organizations:**
The next competitive advantage isn't faster shipping. It's deeper understanding. The best software teams won't just ship faster—they'll understand deeper, listen better, and ask what no one else thought to ask.

**The vision:**
"If we do it right, the next golden age of software won't just be artificial. It'll be intellectual."

Powered by AI labor. Guided by human wisdom. Built from collective thinking. Grounded in clear understanding.

This is what becomes possible when we stop treating freed time as permission to sprint faster, and start treating it as an opportunity to think deeper.
